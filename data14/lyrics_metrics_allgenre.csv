How your mama ran off and pawned her ring

You're drinkin' everything to ease your mind
But when the hell are you gonna ease mine?

Found the bottom of the bottle's always dry

No, I ain't perfect but I'm learning
How to be the best I can
But I got demons collecting dust
And I've buried them so damn far down
So they can't find their way back up

So don't mistake my kindness for weakness
'Cause I can flip that switch
And you can find out quick

There's a hell on the other side
That you ain't met yet, tread real light
Dare you to light that fuse
'Cause I can be a loose cannon
Cross the line, I'll call your bluff

That you don't want that smoke
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't

If you shoot your shot better pray to God

When the life I've lived is reflected on my face
I sneak a peek at the mirror, and what I see is not bad
I relaxed my shoulders, to be upright
Dozens of given motivation
At the intersection connecting each neuron
I carefully assemble the meaning and reason of life
The driving distance of a lightning delivery ball
Whether it be short or long is up to each's decision
I no longer embrace bombs
I've passed the ball on to my crew
While I play catchball with my look-alike son on weekends
Metro on the outskirts
The metronome next to my childhood piano
Matching it became my job, and the payout keeps pilin' up
Still on thin ice
Anxiety about the future lurks beneath the stage like a ghost
I scream, shout, then come back
To relax with a bland home-cooked meal
Make some white noise

This morning, with bread in my mouth again
Start the day the same way
Ice Americano in one hand all day long
I'm so tired, I might die
Did I see this scene in the subway in your dream yesterday?
Oh, every day passes by, oh, oh

On a normal day in this busy life
Look at that kid

The peaceful sky collapsed
The dark before my eyes turn red
I think I forgot something
I feel like I'm going to cry for no reason
I think it would be better to just pass by
Because I just hate thinking

I lost the sense of concentration I had with caffeine
I feel like I'm going to throw up because I'm worried all day long
Even in the evening, I forget my hunger
It's weird, but you know what?

What should I say the first time I saw him? Do I miss it?
It's funny to me too

The peaceful sky collapsed
The dark before my eyes turn red
I think I forgot something
I feel like I'm going to cry for no reason
I think it would be better to just pass by
Because I just hate thinking

Know me for a long time
Make a sad face, oh-oh
Outside the memory without a trace
Or in the past, in the future, in another dimension, in the world

The peaceful sky collapsed
Even if the dark before my eyes turns red
I feel like I'm missing it again
I feel like I'm going to cry for no reason

Because I just hate thinking

No, I think it's better to pass by

Why you think that 'bout nude
'Cause your view's so rude
Think outside the box
Then you'll like it

Hello my name is Yeppi Yeppi
Slightly dumb the way I talk, but I've got sexy, sexy figure
Well, for a tiara with a diamond
Did you think I'd just laugh as if, laugh as if

Twisted Lorelei that Don't need no man
A bookworm obsessed with philosophy, a Self-made woman
Very flabbergasted by this sassy Story
Audience booing and shouting ""You tricked me you're a liar""

Ah an undressed Movie star
Ah a night of broken starlight
Even if I look tacky or fall apart
Even if I'm not loved anymore

Yes I'm a nude
Nude ttattaratttara
Yes I'm a nude
Nude I don't give a love

Baby how do I look, how do I look
Put on my beautiful self and ttattaratttara
Baby how do I look, how do I look
Put on my beautiful self and ttattaratttara

(Ouch!)
Excusez-moi, to all of you who are sitting here
If you were expecting some rated R show
Oh I'm sorry, but that's not what we're showing
For Refund, see that direction,
Whatever people say is not my interest
You're welcome to throw those popcorns
Rating is just the inverse of bliss
But my climax, I feel sick
Of those prejudice made by themselves

Ah an undressed Movie star
Ah no more shameless night
Even if I look tacky or perhaps to you
Even if I'm not loved anymore

Yes I'm a nude
Nude ttattaratttara
Yes I'm a nude
Nude I don't give a love

Baby how do I look, how do I look
Put on my beautiful self and ttattaratttara
Baby how do I look, how do I look
Put on my beautiful self and ttattaratttara

Um ha um ha um ha um

Why you think that 'bout nude

Untie everything that's been tangled up
Can't live life standing still

Gonna know it's over (Ayy)
Where you're from, where you are, your age, religion, and even country
No boundaries, all of it, it doesn't matter
To the point of madness with crazy people
Shake it until you're about to overheat
Yeah, want it, want it and
Burn it, burn it, again let's play more
It's hot in here
Bounce up higher and higher
It's exploding, fly as far as you can
Gimme, it's a vibe snatch
Follow my dance or wave the white flag
Can't do that? It's a self-drag

Bring back the microphone, raise the volume
Sit back and relax everybody

I've never faked my attitude towards you, no cap
It's full of stuff I want to tell you, my case

Numerous emotions collide, what's going on

Rolling in the deep inside my head
You got me bad
Letting my guard down
Swiftly moving towards you, on my way

Why do I keep getting attracted
I'm drawn to you like a magnet

I crumbled before your eyes
Hit rock bottom and sunk deeper
To grab onto the last bit of hope
I've tried to reach out with both of my hands

Again in this dark place, light up the sky
While looking into your eyes, I'll kiss you goodbye
Laugh all you want while you still can
Because it's about to be your turn 1, 2, 3

Don't like me? Then tell me how you like that, like that

In this even darker place shine like the stars
With a smile on my face I'll kiss you goodbye
Laugh all you want while you still can

El parti√≥ en un barco en el muelle de San Blas.
El jur√≥ que volver√≠a,
Y empapada en llanto ella jur√≥ que esperar√≠a...
Miles de lunas pasaron,
Y siempre ella estaba en el muelle,
Esperando...
Muchas tardes se anidaron,
Se anidaron en su pelo
Y en sus labios.

Llevaba el mismo vestido
y por si √©l volviera no se fuera a equivocar.
Los cangrejos le mord√≠an
Su ropaje, su tristeza y su ilusi√≥n...
Y el tiempo se escurri√≥,
Y sus ojos se le llenaron de amaneceres.
Y del mar se enamor√≥,
Y su cuerpo se enraiz√≥
En el muelle.

Sola,
Sola en el olvido.
Sola,
Sola con su esp√≠ritu.
Sola,
Sola con su amor el mar.
Sola...
En el muelle de San Blas.

Su cabello se blanque√≥
Pero ning√∫n barco a su amor le devolv√≠a.
Y en el pueblo le dec√≠an,
Le dec√≠an la loca del muelle de San Blas.
Y una tarde de abril
La intentaron transladar al manicomio;
Nadie la pudo arrancar,
Y del mar nunca jam√°s la separaron.

Sola,
Sola en el olvido.
Sola,
Sola con su esp√≠ritu.

Sola con su amor el mar.

Se qued√≥ hasta el fin.

E lo sai, l'amore non si può cantare in una strofa da otto

Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold

So, Dad would take the Sundays off.
And that's the only time he could ever get any rest.
And so, because we were loud on Sundays, he'd make us hold his construction boots over our head, 'til we'd sleep.
And they were really heavy boots and I used to say, ""Dad, come on, please.""
And like start crying, 'cause they're too heavy.

And I wonder
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you

Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine.""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine.""
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said ""We are all just prisoners here, of our own device""
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember
I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before

It means forever and that's a mighty long time

A world of never-ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night

So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one Dr. Everything'll Be Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby

'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the afterworld
In this life
You're on your own

And if the elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy - punch a higher floor

If you don't like the world you're living in
Take a look around you
At least you got friends

You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
""Uh uh"" was all I heard

Are we gonna let the elevator
Bring us down
Oh, no let's go!

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!

We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause
We're all gonna die

And when we do (when we do)
What's it all for (what's it all for)
You better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door

Tell me, are we gonna let the elevator bring us down
Oh, no let's go!

Too bad, but it's the life you lead
You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need
Though you can see when you're wrong
You know you can't always see when you're right (you're right)
You got your passion, you got your pride
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied?
Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true (Oooh)

Take the phone off the hook and disappear for a while

And he spent a long time watching 
From his lonely wooden tower 
And when he knew for certain 
Only drowning men could see him 
He said ""All men will be sailors then 
Until the sea shall free them"" 
But he himself was broken 
Long before the sky would open 
Forsaken, almost human 
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone 
And you want to travel with him 
And you want to travel blind 
And you think maybe you'll trust him 
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind.

And she leads you to the river

From Salvation Army counters 
And the sun pours down like honey 
On our lady of the harbour 
And she shows you where to look 
Among the garbage and the flowers 
There are heroes in the seaweed 
There are children in the morning 
They are leaning out for love 
And they will lean that way forever

I saw above me that endless skyway
I saw below me that golden valley

To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
And all around me a voice was sounding
This land was made for you and me

When the sun came shining, and I was strolling
And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling
As the fog was lifting a voice was chanting
This land was made for you and me

As I went walking I saw a sign there
And on the sign it said ""No Trespassing""
But on the other side it didn't say nothing
That side was made for you and me

In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people
By the relief office I seen my people
As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking
Is this land made for you and me?

I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la la la la, la la la, la la...
La, la, la la la la, la la la, la la...

After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la la la la, la la la, la la...

After nine days I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with its life underground
And a perfect disguise all above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name

We're all boxed in, nowhere to escape

City's just a jungle, more games to play
Trapped in the heart of it, tryin' to get away

I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down

Got nothing for you, I had nothing before
Don't even have anything for myself anymore

Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme

Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all
I was thinking about the things that Rosie said
I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed

Walking through the leaves, falling from the trees
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees
So many things that we never will undo
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too

Some people will offer you their hand and some won't
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't
I need something strong to distract my mind
I'm gonna look at you 'til my eyes go blind

Well I got here following the southern star
I crossed that river just to be where you are
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

Well my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free
I've got nothing but affection for all those who sailed with me

Everybody's moving, if they ain't already there
Everybody's got to move somewhere
Stick with me baby, stick with me anyhow
Things should start to get interesting right about now

My clothes are wet, tight on my skin
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine

Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way

3 conductors, 25 sacks of mail

All along the southbound odyssey, the train pulls out of Kankakee
And rolls along past houses farms and fields
Passing trains that have no name, and freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles

Good morning America, how are you
Said don't you know me, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done

Dealing card games, with the old men in the club car
Penny a point ain't no one keeping score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels, rumblin' 'neath the floor

And the sons of Pullman porters, and the sons of engineers
Ride their fathers' magic carpets, made of steel
And mothers with their babes asleep, are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Halfway home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness, rolling down to the sea

But all the towns and people seem, to fade into a bad dream
And the steel rail still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his songs again, the passengers will please refrain

I keep waiting for the world to change
Wintertime, summers too
I keep hoping for something new

If it don't break it'll burst
If it's not bad it's worse
If it don't bleed it really hurts!

Bad storms or clear skies
Those politicians keep telling lies
Daylight, deep dark
They steal hope from the people's hearts

It's not a sin, it's the law
It's rich tax the poor
It's never less, it's always more!

Sunset to dawn
People love just'a doing wrong

Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do

One day now, things could change
If people stopped behaving strange
Smile at strangers, neighbours too
Lock those leaders in London's zoo!

And if I had a dream come true
It's God's Garden I'm looking to
Somewhere in there is me and there's you

So I ran, fearing not where I'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
And the flowers I knew, in the fields where I grew
Were content to be lost in the crowd
They were common and close, I had no room for growth
And I wanted so much to branch out
So I uprooted myself from my home ground and left
Took my dreams and I took to the road
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
I grew up fast and wild and I never felt right
In a garden so different from me
I just never belonged, I just longed to be gone
So the garden one day set me free
I hitched a ride with the wind, and since he was my friend
I just let him decide where we'd go

That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear-skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth
And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say, ""Come dance with me""
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems
At seventeen
A brown eyed girl in hand-me-downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said, ""Pity, please, the ones who serve
They only get what they deserve""
And the rich-relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly
Remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality
And dubious integrity
Their small-town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received
At seventeen
To those of us who knew the pain
Of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
When dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me
We all play the game, and when we dare
To cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown

Side-tracked by the scent of a woman.
Could've been an actor on the moviescreen,
Stayed in Alabama just a dreamer of dreams.
… He played football against W.S. Neil
Should've seen him running down the field.
I grow old, I grow old, I wear the bottoms of my
Trousers rolled.
It's a love song for Bobby Long.
A love song for Bobby Long.
… He was a handsome man, he had Cherokee cheeckbones.
A fair haired boy, where did he go wrong?
He chose the road less travelled, made all the difference.
Now he's chastized, criticized, he don't make no sense.
Brewton called him crazy, said Bobby Long was nothing but a drunk.
But all the thoughts in his head was way passed anything they done thunk.
It's a love song for Bobby Long.
A love song for Bobby Long.
… But don't get me wrong, Bobby Long wasn't no good.
He'd drag you down if he thought he could,
Well he would, drag you down.
The road I ride will be the death of me.
Won't you come along?
The road I ride is gonna set me free.
It's gonna take me home.
… He was a friend of my papa's he used to drink and tell lies.
Praised Flannery O'Connors, smoked cigarettes and philosophied.
So here I am at The Colonial Inn.
Me and Cap'n Long and my pretty girl-friend.
Well he charmes her with a poem, then he brakes down and cries,
Smiles a crooked smile, with his broken cheeck-bone side.
Tells about his life, now he's 63.
He looks me in the eyes and says come and go with me.
He could walk on water, walk on water,
But you know he drowned himself in wine.
God and the devil, God and the devil,
God and the devil along inside his mind.
It's a love song for Bobby Long.
A love song for Bobby Long.","melancholic, nostalgic, conflicted",1,0,0,0

Left its seeds while I was sleeping

Still remains

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a streetlamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools,"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sounds of silence.""","melancholic, contemplative, introspective",1,0,0,1

I was taken by a photograph of you
There were one or two I know that you would have liked a little more
But they didn't show your spirit quite as true
You were turning around to see who was behind you
And I took your childish laughter by surprise
And at the moment that my camera happened to find you
There was just a trace of sorrow in your eyes
Now, the things that I remember seem so distant, so small
Though it hasn't really been that long a time
What I was seeing wasn't what was happening at all
Although for a while our path did seem to climb
When you see through love's illusions, there lies the danger
And your perfect lover just looks like a perfect fool
So you go running off in search of a perfect stranger
While the loneliness seems to spring from your life
Like a fountain from a pool
Fountain of sorrow, fountain of light
You've known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight
You've had to hide sometimes, but now you're all right
And it's good to see your smiling face tonight
Now, for you and me it may not be that hard to reach our dreams
But that magic feeling never seems to last
And while the future's there for anyone to change, still you know it seems
It would be easier sometimes to change the past
I'm just one or two years and a couple of changes behind you
In my lessons at love's pain and heartache school
Where if you feel too free, and you need something to remind you
There's this loneliness springing up from your life
Like a fountain from a pool
Fountain of sorrow, fountain of light
You've known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight
You've had to hide sometimes, but now you're all right
And it's good to see your smiling face tonight
Fountain of sorrow, fountain of light
You've known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight
You've had to struggle, you've had to fight
To keep understanding and compassion in sight (ahh-ah-ah-ah)
You could be laughing at me, you've got the right (ahh-ah-ah-ah)

Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail

Pirate ships would lower their flags when Puff roared out his name

Painted wings and giant's rings make way for other toys
One gray night it happened, Jackie Paper came no more
And Puff, that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar
His head was bent in sorrow, green scales fell like rain
Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane
Without his lifelong friend, Puff could not be brave
So Puff, that mighty dragon, sadly slipped into his cave

Lord Donald's wife came into the church, the gospel for to hear
And when the meeting it was done, she cast her eyes about
And there she saw little Matty Groves, walking in the crowd
""Come home with me, little Matty Groves, come home with me tonight
Come home with me, little Matty Groves, and sleep with me till light""
""Oh, I can't come home, I won't come home and sleep with you tonight
By the rings on your fingers I can tell you are my master's wife""
""But if I am Lord Donald's wife, Lord Donald's not at home
He is out in the far cornfields bringing the yearlings home""
And a servant who was standing by and hearing what was said
He swore Lord Donald he would know before the sun would set
And in his hurry to carry the news, he bent his breast and ran
And when he came to the broad millstream, he took off his shoes and he swam
Little Matty Groves, he lay down and took a little sleep
When he awoke, Lord Donald was standing at his feet
Saying ""How do you like my feather bed and how do you like my sheets
How do you like my lady who lies in your arms asleep?""
""Oh, well I like your feather bed and well I like your sheets
But better I like your lady gay who lies in my arms asleep""
""Well, get up, get up, "" Lord Donald cried, ""get up as quick as you can
It'll never be said in fair England that I slew a naked man""
""Oh, I can't get up, I won't get up, I can't get up for my life
For you have two long beaten swords and I not a pocket knife""
""Well it's true I have two beaten swords and they cost me deep in the purse
But you will have the better of them and I will have the worse
And you will strike the very first blow and strike it like a man
I will strike the very next blow and I'll kill you if I can""
So Matty struck the very first blow and he hurt Lord Donald sore
Lord Donald struck the very next blow and Matty struck no more
And then Lord Donald took his wife and he sat her on his knee
Saying ""Who do you like the best of us, Matty Groves or me?""
And then up spoke his own dear wife, never heard to speak so free
""I'd rather a kiss from dead Matty's lips than you or your finery""
Lord Donald he jumped up and loudly he did bawl
He struck his wife right through the heart and pinned her against the wall
""A grave, a grave, "" Lord Donald cried, ""to put these lovers in
But bury my lady at the top for she was of noble kin""","Betrayed, passionate, tragic",0,0,0,0

Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles
Such are promises
All lies and jest
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest
When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me, going home
In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving""

And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E 

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl


Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth

It's ""Turn Out the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, After-mathematics
In the home of drivebys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E

And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

It ain't nothing but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're cooling on a corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representing for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap

Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back

[Snoop]
So if you ain't up on thangs

[Dr. Dre]
Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still, got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless

Ya, let's take em back
Uh huh

Comin up I was confused my momma kissin a girl
Confusion occurs comin up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around probably out commitin felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing ch-check out my melody
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope for a fo-finger ring
One of them gold ropes 
NaNa told me if I pass could get a sheep skin coat 
If I can move a few packs and get the hat, now that'd be dope

Tossed and turned in my sleep that night 
Woke up the next morning niggas done stole my bike
Different day same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

[Chorus (50 then Game):]
Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop

Go head' envy me
I'm raps MVP
And I ain't goin nowhere so you can get to know me

Hate it or love it the underdog's on top

And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop

Go head' envy me
I'm raps MVP
And I ain't goin nowhere so you can get to know me

[Game]
On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides right above the gold wires
I'll fo-five em
Kill a nigga on my song but really do it
Thats the true meaning of a ~ghostwriter~
10 g'z will take ya daughter out of Air Forces
Believe you me homie i know all bout losses
I'm from Compton where the wrong colors be cautious
One phone call will have ya body dumped in Marcy

I stay strapped like car seats
Been bangin since my lil nigga Rob got killed for his Barkley's
That's 10 years I told Pooh in 95' I'd kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95s
Told Banks when i met him imma ride 
And if I gotta die rather homicide 
I ain't have 50 Cent when my Grandmomma died
Now i'm goin back to Cali with my Jacob on
See how time fly?

[Chorus - 50 Cent]

From the beginnin to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in
Is full of pressure and pain

Enough of me nigga now listen to Game

[Game]
Used to see 5-0 throw the crack by the bench
Now i'm fuckin with ~5-0~ it's all startin to make ~sense~
My moms happy she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waitin on Sha Money to land sittin in the Range
Thinkin how they spend 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin
Pac is gone and Brendas still throwin babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's goin on like i hear Marvin
No school books they use that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and i get exhausted 

I think what if Marie Banker got that abortion
I love ya Ma'

Ain't nuttin but a G thang, baaaaabay !
Two lock'ed out niggaz so we're craaaaazay !
Death Row is the label that paaaaays me !
Unfadeable, so please don't try to fade this (Hell yeah ! )
But uhh, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected, so I'ma let em understand

From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a bitch I have to find a contraceptive
You never know she could be earnin her man
End learnin her man - and at the same time burnin her man
Now you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it (YEAH ! )
And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff

[Dr. Dre and Snoop]
It's like this and like that and like this and uh

[S] Dre, creep to the mic like a phantom

[Dr. Dre]
Well I'm peepin, and I'm creepin, and I'm creep-in
But I damn near got caught, cause my beeper kept beepin
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax, and strap on your seatbelt
You never been on a ride like this befo'
With a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time, with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know, and I know, I flow some ol funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection
Symbolizes dope, take a toke, but don't choke

If you do, you'll have no clue
On what me and my homey Snoop Dogg came to do

[Dr. Dre and Snoop]
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh

[Snoop Doggy Dogg] (Dr. Dre)
Fallin back on that ass, with a hellafied gangsta lean
Gettin funky on the mic like a old batch of Collard green
It's the capital S, oh yes I'm fresh, N double-O P

D O double-G Y, D O double-G, ya see
Showin much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimpin hoes and clockin a grip like my name was Dolomite
Yeah, and it don't quit
I think they in the mood for some motherfuckin G shit
(Hell yeah ! ) So Dre (Whattup Dogg ? )
Gotta give em what they want (What's that, G ? )
We gotta break em off somethin (Hell yeah ! )
And it's gotta be bumpin (City of Compton ! )

[Dr. Dre]
It's where it takes place so when asked, yo' attention
Mobbin like a muh'fucker, but I ain't lynchin
Droppin the funky shit that's makin the sucka niggaz mumble

When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble
Try to get close, and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, cause if I slip, then I'm slippin
But if I got my Nina, then you know I'm straight trippin
And I'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit, I'll have to put the smack down
Yeah, and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on, to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, and the city they call Long Beach

Puttin the shit together
Like my nigga D. O. C. , ""No One Can Do it Better""

Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin

You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't

Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk

Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention

Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'

Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes

You can't put it out once we light it

Regulators, mount up!

[Warren G & Nate Dogg]
It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets tryin' to consume
Some skirts for the eve so I can get some funk
Rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone
Just hit the east side of the LBC
On a mission tryna find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213
So, I hooks a left on 21 and Lewis

Some brothers shootin' dice, so I said ""Let's do this!""
I jumped out the ride and said ""What's up?""
Some brothers pulled some gats, so I said ""I'm stuck!""
Since these girls peepin' me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Onto bigger, better things than some horny tricks
I see my homie and some suckas all in his mix

[Warren G & Nate Dogg]
I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they takin' Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brothers, said ""Damn, what's next?""

They got my homie hemmed up and they all around
Can't none of them see him if they goin' straight pound-for-pound
They wanna come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them bustas down
They got guns to my head, I think I'm goin' down
I can't believe it's happenin' in my own town
If I had wings I would fly, let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homie Nate
Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin', it's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate

[Nate Dogg & Warren G]
I laid all them bustas down, I let my gat explode

Now I'm switchin' my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts, sit back and observe
I just left a gang of hoes over there on the curb
Now, Nate got the freaks and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up, back up, 'cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me, the Warren to the G
Just like I thought, they were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
But Nate Dogg and the G child
Were in need of somethin' else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said, ""Ooh, I like your size!""
She said, ""My car's broke down and you seem real nice
Would you let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's goin' real swell

The next stop is the Eastside Motel

[ Warren G & Nate Dogg]
I'm tweaking into a whole new era
G-funk, step to this, I dare ya
Funk on a whole new level
The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble
Chords, strings, we brings melody, G-funk
Where rhythm is life and life is rhythm
If you know like I know, you don't wanna step to this
It's the G-funk era, funked out with a gangsta twist
If you smoke like I smoke, then you're high like every day

Lauryn Hill),Nas,"Intro: Nas (Lauryn Hill singing in the background)

Life..... I wonder....
Will it take me under.... I don't know

Verse One: Nas

Imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassin
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle cruising blue behind my waters
No welfare supporters more conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra

The world's hot my son got knocked evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage we'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashin, fashion
Designer clothes, lacing your click up with diamond rolls
Your people holdin dough, no parole
No rubbers, go in raw imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""

Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Nas

If I ruled the world Imagine that

I'd free all my sons, I love em love em baby
Black diamonds and pearls Could it be, if you could 
be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world Still livin for today, in
these last days and times

Verse Two: Nas

It'd be, paradise, life, relaxin black, latino and anglo-saxon
Armani exchange the range
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash then we laugh in the iller path

The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years in depression make me vision
The better livin, type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controlling, click rollin
Trickin six digits on kicks and still holdin
Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage
Gimme one shot I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisonners set free, stress free 
No work release purple M3's and jet skis 
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities and reverse fiends to Willies

It sounds foul but every girl I meet would go downtown
I'd open every cell in Attica send em to Africa

Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Nas

If I ruled the world Imagine that
I'd free all my sons, I love em love em baby
Black diamonds and pearls Could it be, if you could 
be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world Still livin for today, in
these last days and times


And then we'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land
We'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

Verse Three: Nas

You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Runnin from Jake, gettin chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks many mistakes go down out of state
Wait, I had to let it marinate we carry weight

Tryin to get laced, flip the ace stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Makin moves in Atlanta, back and forth scrambler
Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still nobody wants 2 see a nigga havin shit
But if I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I push the Q-45 Infinit
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or Beef Felonies
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck???

Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Nas


If I ruled the world Imagine that
I'd free all my sons, I love em em baby
Black diamonds and pearls Could it be, if you could 
be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world Still livin for today, in
these last days and times

If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled Imagine that
I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled
I love em love em baby
Black diamonds and pearls, black dimaonds Could it be, if you could

black diamonds be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world Still livin for today, in
these last days and times

If I ruled the world, if I ruled
if I ruled, I'd free all my sons
black diamonds, I love em love em baby
Black diamonds and pearls, if I ruled

Not clashin?, not at all 
But see my nigga went to do a little actin?
Now that?s for anyone askin? 
Give me one, pass em?

We tappin? right into your memory banks (Thanks)

Make it sound like aluminum cans in the back

(Verse 2) [Big Boi]
The whole room fell silent, (Shhhhh!) the girls all paused with glee 
Turnin? left, turning right are they lookin? at me?
Well I was looking at them, there, there on the dance floor
Now, they got me in the middle feelin? like a man-whore
Especially the big girl, big girls need love too 
No discrimination here, squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
Let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak!
Skinny, slim women got the camel-toe within ?em 
You can hump them, lift them, bend them, give them something to remember

Yell out ?timber? when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep a breath and exhale 
Your ex-male friend, boyfriend was boring as hell
Well let me listen to the story you tell 
And we can make moves like a person in jail... on the low, hoe!

[Sleepy Brown]
Hey baby, girl don?t you stop it
Come on lady, dance all around me 
You look so fine, look so fine 
Drive me out of my mind, out of my mind, out of my mind (Aawww baby!)
If I could, I would just leave with you, baby
Oooooh, ?cause you light me and excite me 

And you know you got me, baby (Wooooo!)

Let it bump though
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life
From standin' on the corners boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
For droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock fleein' the murder scene
You know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all n- know me to fail? F- naw
Where all my n- with the rubber grips, bust shots?
And if you with me, mom, I rub on your -, and what-not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it 50-50, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my n- Biggie, baby
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter, n-, Volume 2
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life
I flow for those 'dro'ed out
All my n- locked down in the 10 by 4, controllin' the house
We live in hard knocks, we don't take over, we borrow blocks
Burn 'em down and you can have it back, daddy, I'd rather that
I flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition
I see your vision mama, I put my money on the longshots
All my ballers that's born to clock
Know I'ma be on top whether I perform or not
I went from lukewarm to hot, sleepin' on futons and cots
To King size, green machines, to green 5's
I've seen pies, let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down type braille
I'm tight grill with the phony, rappers y'all might feel we homies
I'm like still, y'all don't know me, sh-
I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin'
I'm tryna murder everything movin', feel me

It's the hard knock life for us

Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life
I don't know how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes
Got a lot of beef, so logically, I prey on my foes
Hustling's still inside of me, and as far as progress
You'd be hard-pressed to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out
Didn't really appreciate it 'til the second one came out
So I stretched the game out, etched your name out
Put Jigga on top, and drop albums non-stop for ya, n-

Keep it gangsta for the cowards so I give 'em hell
Call me misfit, lips spit a gang of trash
Wrist glist now 'cause I make a gang of cash
Light glance, still street with the doo-rag
Slang, spit game, change speech, how they do that? Huh
Watch they mouths drop, watch the crowds pop up and act out
Broads with the screw face, smash on and knock out
Ain't changed, game don't run me, I run the game
If I gotta keep it gritty, so be it, I'm supposed to change
Like simple, dizzy broads ain't fuckin' with my mental

Realness, real shit, spit reality
Attitude rude, that's the Philly in I
Need me in the game, I'm the thrill in your life
Breath of fresh air
Little boys hang me on their wall, I grow 'em chest hair
Why you listenin' to other shit? You got the best here
Come on try your luck, shorty, I got the rest scared
Bet you anything you ain't ready and you get left there
Ain't known for frontin', vouch for my behavior
Same way they get down, I get down for this paper
16 lean from my pen so you can test her
Still need to know who I am, then cop the record
Take it like a class on me and learn the lesson

So hardball is played, won't starve today
Song after song I write so I get paid
Thought I wasn't followin' up with the second round
Now bitch, swallow it up while I shove it down
Make 'em love me over again and over your name
Betcha they get over your style and over your fame

You gotta have the one Killer Bee and he ain't gonna kill. Now

For any MC in any 52 states,

My producer slam, sharp like bam!
Jump on stage, and then I dun-daaaah!

Hey you, sittin' over there (say what?)
You better get up out of your chair (that's right)
And work your body down (yeah)
No time to funk around 'cause we gon'
Funk you right on up
So get up, get a move on, and get your groove on
It's the D-R-E the spectacular
In a party, I go for your neck so call me ""Blacula""
As I drain a nigga's jugular vein
And maintain to leave blood stains so don't complain
Just chill, listen to the beats I spill
Keepin' it real, enables me to make another meal
Still, niggas run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple, so call me Clearasil
I wipe niggas off the face of the Earth since birth
I been a bad nigga, now let me tell you what I'm worth
More than a stealth bomber, I cause drama
The enforcer, music flows like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet, never forget
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes panties wet
The mic gets smoked, once you hear the beat kick
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'

Keep their heads ringin'

Five for the hoes, six, seven, eight for Death Row
Mad niggas about to feel the full effect of intellect
So I can collect respect, plus a check
Now, I fin' to, get into to my mental
Will take care of this business, I need to attend to 'cause my rent's due
And this rap shit's my meal ticket
So you goddamn right I'ma kick it, or get evicted
I bring terror like Stephen King
A black Casanova, runnin' nigga over like Christine
When I rock the spot with the flavor I got
I get plenty of ass, so call me an ass-tronaut
As I blast past another nigga's ass that thought he was strong
But I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong
When I flow, niggas know, it's time to take a hike
'Cause I grab the mic and flip, my tongue like a dyke
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted
Produce a smokescreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E, I keep their motherfuckin' heads ringin'
Keep their heads ringin'
(Ring, ding-dong, ring-a-ding, ding, ding-dong) yeah, come on
If you want to get on down (uh, yeah)
You got to get on down (come on)
Just get on down (it's like that)
Debonair with flair, I scare wear and tear
Without a care, runnin' shit as if I was a mayor
But I ain't no politician, no competition
Sendin' all opposition to see a mortician
I'm up front, never in the back drop
Step on stage and get faded just like a flat-top
Your rhyme sounds like you bought 'em at Stop 'n Go
Dre came to wax you so, just call me Mop and Glo
Many tried to, but just can't rock with
I'm 6'1"", 225 of pure chocolate
Your chances of jackin' me are slim, G
'Cause I rock from summer 'til Santa comes down the chimney
Ho-ho-ho and so, as I continue to flow
'Cause yo, I'm just a fly negro, so
Check the flavor that I'm bringin'

Everybody moves to the back of the bus
Do you wanna bump and slump with us
We're the type of people make the club get crunk

Many a day has passed, the night has gone by
But still I find the time to put that bump off in your eye
Total chaos, for these playas, thought we was absent
We takin another route to represent the Dungeon Family
Like Great Day, me and my nigga decide to take the back way

We stabbing every city then we headed to that bat cave
A-T-L, Georgia, what we do for ya
Bull doggin hoes like them Georgetown Hoyas
Boy you sounding silly, thank my Brougham aint sittin pretty
Doing doughnuts round you suckas like then circles around titties
Damn we the committee gone burn it down
But us gone bust you in the mouth with the chorus now

I met a gypsy and she hipped me to some life game
To stimulate then activate the left and right brain
Said baby boy you only funky as your last cut

You focus on the past your ass'll be a has what
Thats one to live by or either that one to die to
I try to just throw it at you determine your own adventure
Andre, got to her station here's my destination
She got off the bus, the conversation lingered in my head for hours
Took a shower kinda sour cause my favorite group ain't comin with it
But I'm witcha you cause you probably goin through it anyway
But anyhow when in doubt went on out and bought it
Cause I thought it would be jammin but examine all the flawsky-wawsky
Awfully, it's sad and it's costly, but that's all she wrote
And I hope I never have to float in that boat

Up shit creek it's weak is the last quote
That I want to hear when I'm goin down when all's said and done
And we got a new joe in town
When the record player get to skippin and slowin down
All yawl can say is them niggas earned that crown but until then...

Pretty girls in the V.I.P
They came with Dre, they don't need ID
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Your mind is gone, your brain is blazed
You've been wide awake for the last three days
Poppin' pills, it goes down for real
Don't stop, just keep rollin' down hill
Crash and burn, can't stand, fall back
You're doin' too much, you can't handle all that
Man, it's been way too long
Time to let the whole world play your songs
Like me, my shit gets around
Leave the country come back and hit The Town
I'm in Miami, New York and ATL
Houston and L.A., ask Dave Chappelle
About my rich bitch, he got her from me
And made 50 million dollars, I'm proud of you D
But I'm crazy, you don't wanna be like me
I come from East Oakland where the youngstas get hyphy
Blow it
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle

Too $hort

California love

[Chorus: Roger Troutman]
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends
I been in the game for ten years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre puttin' it down for Californ-i-a

[Chorus: Roger Troutman]
California knows how to party
California knows how to party (Yes, they do)
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'

Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it

[Verse 2: 2Pac & Dr. Dre]
Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreamin'
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'
Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys (Yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we throw grams
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down; give me love!

[Chorus: Roger Troutman]
California knows how to party
California knows how to party (Yes, they do)
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton

I'm the definition of, half man, half drugs
Ask the clubs, Bad Boy, that's wassup?
After bucks, crush crews after us
No games, we ain't laughing much
Nothin' but big things, check the hit list
How we twist shit, what change but the name?
We still here, you rockin' wit the best
Don't worry if I write rhymes, I write checks
Who's the boss? Dudes is lost
Don't think 'cause I'm iced out, I'ma cool off
Who else but me? And if you don't feel me
That mean you can't touch me, it's ugly, trust me
Get it right dawg, we ain't ever left
We just, moved in silence and rep to the death
It's official, I survived what I been through
Y'all got drama, the saga continues

Ay, yo straight from the Harlem streets
I don't play, I push it down with the Harlem Heat
All a sudden niggas got a problem with me
They run around actin like the Black-o can't eat
And you know what? For some strange reason
I'm off of this medication, feeling deranged needing
For y'all to put the word out, we ain't leavin'
We tryin' to be rich before we do stop breathin'
Therefore we kinda hustle lames
Stay laying down our muscle games
Still turn niggas dreams to flames
You got the wire, if not I ain't sayin' no more names
You'll soon expire, no pain, nothing
I feel remorse, yes of course it's me and Diddy up first racing Porsches
With the big twin valve exhausts
On the cover of your Vibes, XXLs, and Sources, bitch
We ain't, goin' nowhere, we ain't, goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now 'cause it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't, goin' nowhere, we ain't, goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now 'cause it's Bad Boy for life
It ain't shit changed, since the Notorious (We miss you B.I.G.)
See everything still glorious
We still got warriors, still be the victorious
See it's a lot of them but it's more of us
Still got cash to blow, raps that flow
Still them cats that know, pack ya flow
That's fo' sho', bottles that pop
Joints that rock, play the background
Hand on my jock, holdin' my Glock
Money to get, cars to flip
Bars to sit at and sip Cognac wit' jewels that drip
Hoes to see, make sure they knowin' it's me
Drop that beat, can't believe that I MC
Bad Boy 'til the casket drop
Gotta love it, place nuttin' above it

I see no changes, wake up in the morning, and I ask myself
Is life worth living, should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor, and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares
One less hungry mouth on the welfare
First, ship 'em dope and let 'em deal the brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
It's time to fight back, that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother, but we can never go nowhere
Unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the devil take a brother, if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things changed, and that's the way it is
Come on, come on
That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Ooh, yeah
Come on, come on
That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww, yeah
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be acting right
'Cause mo' black and white is smokin' crack tonight
And only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven sent
We ain't ready, to see a black President
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
(I made a G today) But you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kid (I gotta get paid)
Well, hey, well, that's the way it is
Come on, come on
That's just the way it is

That's just the way it is

Come on, come on
That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww, yeah
We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat
Let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see, the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do
What we gotta do, to survive
And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace?
There's war in the streets and war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty, they got a war on drugs
So the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime, I ain't have to do
But now, I'm back with the facts givin' 'em back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimps smack you up
You gotta learn to hold ya own
They get jealous when they see ya, with ya mobile phone
But tell the cops, they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush, I bust this
That's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool?
But mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the pay backs

The first day of the rest of my life
X stand behing the mic like Walker Kronkike
Y'all keep the spotlight
I'm keeping my rhymes tight
Lose sight of wath you believe and call it a night
This ain't the light-weight, cake mix shit that you're used to
Teflon territory you just can't shoot through
You gon shoot who ? (who ? )

Not even on your best day
Rollin' the Wild West way, givin' it up
Leaving the whole world stuck not givin' a fuck
Laid in the cut now we break through in the rut
Hennesy and orange juice bay fill up a cup
Quick to grab Mary Jane by the butt and squeeze
Loosen up, let your hair down, and join the festivities
Overcrowd the house like lockdown facilities
Bitches be quick to give me brains while I post the range
Going up and down my dick like the stok exange

X won't ever say your own name when I come around
X stay on top but remain from the underground

X rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
X won't ever say your own name when I come around

Ever since Xzibit has spit, been on some pimp shit
Approach every woman like a potential mistress
Shine bright, make sure that (X) stay tight
Cause tonight I might meet my next X wife
Mr Big Chief Reefa, Xzibit use his dick like a Visa
I run it throught and money come out
Runnin' your mouth, I'll have somebody run in your house
Ravel you spouse and have a little fun on the couch
Now you know that it was bound to happen

I came to give you what you lackin'
Whenever you hear them other niggas rappin
Rockin' chains, stadium, paladiums, cracked craniums
My whole skeleton is dipped in titanium
Drop tops sittin' on twenties
Using rappers like crash test dummies
Stacking' real estate and money
It's funny how things change overnight
When you thinking right
I beat the odds like Ike beat on his first wife

X won't ever say your own name when I come around

We hardcore 100%
Making it stick, Los Angeles proudly presents
The real deal, how does it feel ?
No special effects
Yank the chain off of your neck
Demand the respect
Now all your conversations sound strange to me It be like everybody around me done changed but me
I stand alone on my own two feet
Stagger tracks, strangle the beat
Restless no time for sleep
Niggas be weak, I'm concrete like Benjamin Greet
It's a very thin line between a foe and friend

Straight to the chair (not these niggas again)
Comme back, bounce in the spot and slide right in
I ain't trying to see nothing but progress, regardless
Home of the heartless, move right, remain cautious
Represent nothing but the hustle and struggle
Hennesy, rock plenty of ice, making a double, now scream

Point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer

It wouldn't be the first time I done it throwin' hundreds


When I should be throwin' ones, bitch, I run it

I know way too many people here right now

That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?

I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back

But I just can't remember it all

What am I doing? What am I doing?

Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me

I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over

'Til it's over, but it's far from over

One thing about music, when it hits you feel no pain

And I swear I got the shit that makes these bitches go insane

So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game


It's what comes with the fame and I'm ready for that, I'm just sayin'

I really can't complain, everything is kosher

Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roper

I really can't see the end getting any closer

But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over

So I'm riding through this city with my high-beams on

Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on

Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your wise friend on

If you thinkin' I'mma quit before I die, dream on

Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?

I'm really too young to be feeling this old

It's about time you admit it, who you kiddin'?

And nobody's ever done it like I did it


I know way too many people here right now

That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?

I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back

But I just can't remember it all

What am I doing? What am I doing?

Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me

I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over

'Til it's over, but it's far from over

Yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me

I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over

Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 

If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)

I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)



Be, B-Boys and girls, listen up 

You can be anything in the world, in God we trust

An architect, doctor, maybe an actress 

But nothing comes easy it takes much practice

Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star

She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe

Singing songs, Lina Horn, but the younger version

Hung with the wrong person

Gotta astrung when I heard when 

Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose


Coulda died, so young, no looks ugly and old

No fun cause when she reaches for hugs people hold they breath

Cause she smells of corrosion and death 

Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring

Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing

So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how



I know I can (I know I can)

If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)

I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)




Be, B-Boys and girls, listen again

This is for grown looking girls who's only ten

The ones who watch videos and do what they see

As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID

Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV

You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey 

Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be

Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be 

Older than you are, give yourself time to grow

You thinking he can give you wealth, but so

Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know

You thinkin life's all about smokin weed and ice

You don't wanna be my age and can't read and right

Begging different women for a place to sleep at night

Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish

If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this




I know I can (I know I can) 

Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 

If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)

I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)



I know I can (I know I can) 

Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 

If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)

I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)



Save the music y'all, save the music y'all

Save the music y'all, save the music y'all

Save the music



Be, be, 'fore we came to this country 


We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys

It was empires in Africa called Kush 

Timbuktu, where every race came to get books

To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans

Asian Arabs and gave them gold when 

Gold was converted to money it all changed 

Money then became empowerment for Europeans

The Persian military invaded 

They learned about the gold, the teachings and everything sacred

Africa was almost robbed naked

Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships 

Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went 

He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces

Shot up they nose to impose what basically 


Still goes on today, you see? 

If the truth is told, the youth can grow 

They learn to survive until they gain control 

Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes

Read more learn more, change the globe

Ghetto children, do your thing

Hold your head up, little man, you're a king

Young Prince thats when you get your wedding ring

Your man is saying ""She's my queen""

Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the 8th wonder of the world
The flow of the century.. oh it's timeless.. HOV'!
Thanks for comin out tonight
You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me
I appreciate that.. uuunnnh..


H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
Was hurtin 'em in the home of the Terrapins; got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthin 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' sheezy my neezy keep my arms so freezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Haters want me clapped and chromed it ain't easy
Cops wanna knock me, D.A. wanna box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof -- vamoose, son of a bitch!

Holla at me...
I do this for my culture
To let 'em know what a nigga look like, when a nigga in a roaster
Show 'em how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry shady it need to be taken over

Label owners hate me I'm raisin the status quo up
I'm overchargin niggaz for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks so talk mo' bucks

[Jay-Z]
Yeah...
Hov' is back, life stories told through rap
Niggaz actin like I sold you crack
Like I told you sell drugs; no, Hov' did that
so hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the pro-jects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back, sellin they mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner, focused on the ave

Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamp post, why I got my hand closed?
Cracks in my palm, watchin the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail, the two things I hate
Succeed in this rap game, the two things that's great
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
What else can I say about dude, I gets bu-sy

Fuck if they holl'in about Rule nigga, here's the real
I'll pop ya top like Champagne bottles that chill
Wear nothing but ice, smiles tinted up to The Greatest
Tell em I'm nice too, plus push them nice grooves
The Inc roll like duece man, I'm ol' G Bobby J.
And we sling at soccer fields the yay

They don't respect that, don't get your minds around
You'll get it pushed back, y'all don't want that
I send em to the morgue while keepin my bitches bouncin fa sho
""In Da Club"" with no gun, got em taking it off
Can't help that, I'm the nigga that puts it down
Once I hit that, that's if I'm up in the May (bach)
Fasten them holding the throwback, West 44 Lakers
Let's make no mistakes, resents take place
We'll still proceedger you with a gun in your face
When you got one in your waist, let's cock back nigga, air out the space!

The Rule be ""In Da Club"" rude motherfucker poppin the bubbly
When shit get ugly I hug the snub closely
But usually we still see your bitches
dancin' on some freak shit, trying to ride my dick
I can't handle it, 'long as they manage
To get they ass infront of my dick to dance to BIG's ""One More Chance""
Catching hate from a glance, but I'm a giant
These niggaz is mere ants, I'll stomp 'em wit his thang
Give bitches the back hand, pimp shit, it's not realistic
The game is helpless, (let's) not get it twisted
I'm young, black, and gifted, but still at the bottom

And stuck somewhere between Gomorrah and Saddam
I'm here to make this rap shit hotter than Harlem
Fuck the Dog, beware of Rule, cause I'm the problem
We'll still proceed you with a gun in your face
When you got one in your waist, let's cock back nigga, air out the space!
(C'mon!) We gon'

[Verse 3 - Ja Rule]
Like Bush and Saddam, I'm a find out
Where Em Laden's hiding and bomb him first
It could be much worse, I could be hotter than yo scrubs
Mask and glove, gun hot from burnin ass up
I'd rather be bossed up, wit a bunch of broads

The preachers daughter screaming out ""Fuck the law!""
ya may have struck a chord, wit the Christians
But y'all got the freakiest bitches out of all the religions
And God gave me his blessings to handle my business
All these wanksta snitches, let the nina blow kisses
If she some how misses, he gon' meet the mistress
And ""Clap That Boy"" like Birdman and Clipse
I got these niggaz all over my dick, like hoes
I'm the star at these shows, I must be as hot as they come
We'll still proceed you with a gun in your face
When you got one in your waist, let's cock back nigga, air out the space!

Take them rhymes back to the factory

I see, the gimmicks, the wack lyrics
The shit is depressing, pathetic, please forget it

Don't be mad, UPS is hiring

The most healthy behavior is to stay in the clear
It's all for you, it's really all for you (Now what?)

Coil up your ankles let your Timbs tap
Bite the flavor it reacts to your gold caps

Bring it vicious when I bust a rhyme
I know one thing the whole world least expected
Is how we all connected to break fool on the same record
Five new flavors on a beat, feel the fucking heat

Instead of copping pleas just freeze
Maintain the focus while we smoke these marijuana trees

Drunk off Cris', mami on E
Can't keep her little model hands off me
Both in the club, high, singing off key
""And I wish I never met her at all!""
It gets better, ordered another round
It's, about, to go, down
Got six model chicks, six bottles of Cris'
Four Belvederes, got weed everywhere
What do you say, me, you, and your Chloe glasses (uh-huh)

How much I'ma spend but you already know
Zip, zero, stingy with dinero
Might buy you Cris', but that about it
Might light your wrist, but that about it
Fuck it, I might wife you and buy you nice whips
Ma, but you really gotta ride nice dick
Know how to work your hips and your head's priceless
Profess you love to Hov' and I'll never let you down
Get you bling like the Neptune sound

New York niggas the wildest
My niggas is with it, you want it? Come and get it
Took it then we split it, you fuckin' right we did it
What the fuck you gon' do when we run up on you?
Fuckin' with the wrong crew
Don't know what we're goin' through
I'ma have to show niggas how easily we blow niggas
When you find out there's some mo' niggas
That's runnin' with yo' niggas
Nothin' we can't handle, break it up and dismantle
Light it up like a candle just 'cause I can't stand you
Put my shit on tapes like you bustin' grapes
Think you holdin' weight?
Then you haven't met the apes
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Is y'all niggas crazy? I'll bust you and be Swayze
Stop actin' like a baby, mind your business, lady!
Nosy people get it too, when you see me spit at you
You know I'm tryin' to get rid of you, yeah I know, it's pitiful
That's how niggas get down
Watch my niggas spit rounds
Make y'all niggas kiss ground just for talkin' shit, clown
Oh, you think it's funny?
Then you don't know me, money
It's about to get ugly, fuck it, dawg, I'm hungry
I guess you know what that mean
Come up off that green, rob niggas on ravine
Don't make it a murder scene
Give a dog a bone, leave a dog alone
Let a dog roam and he'll find his way home
Home of the brave, my home is a cage
Ayo I'ma slave 'til my home is a grave
I'ma pull capers, it's all about the papers
Bitches caught the vapors and now they wanna rape us
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Look what you done started, asked for it, you got it
Had it, shoulda shot it, now you're dearly departed
Get at me, dawg, did I rip shit?
With this one here, I flip shit
Niggas know when I kick shit, it's gon' be some slick shit
What was that look for when I walked in the door?
Oh, you thought you was raw? Boom! Not anymore
'Cause now you on the floor, wishin' you never saw
Me walk through that door with that .44
Now it's time for bed, two more to the head
Got the floor red, yeah, that nigga's dead
Another unsolved mystery, it's goin' down in history
Niggas ain't never did shit to me
Bitch-ass niggas can't get to me
Gots to make the move, got a point to prove
Gotta make them groove, got 'em all like ""Ooh!""
So to the next time you hear this nigga rhyme
Try to keep your mind on gettin' pussy and crime

You see them headlights? You hear that fuckin crowd?
Start that goddamn show, I'm comin through
Hit the stage and knock the curtains down

Young and successful - a sex symbol
The bitches want me to fuck em - true true
Hold up, wait up, shorty
""Oh aww wazzzupp? Get my dick sucked, what are yoouu doin?""
Sidelinin my fuckin business
Tryin to get my paper, child support soon

Give me that truck and take that rental back
Who bought these fuckin T.V.'s and jewelry bitch, tell me that?
No, I ain't bitter, I don't give a fuck
But I'ma tell you like this bitch
You better not walk in front of my tour bus

[Chorus]

[I-20 over second chorus]
Bring it, get 'em

We heard there's hoes out, so we brought the cars out

Grab the peels cuz we robbin tonight
Beat the SHIT outta of security for stoppin the fight

I'm sellin shit up in the club like I work in the bitch
Fuck the dress codes, it's street clothes, we all street niggaz
We on the dance floor, throwin bows, beatin up niggaz

And watch the bottles start flyin from the VIP
Fuck this rap shit, we clap bitch, two in ya body
Grab ya four, start a fight dog, ruin the party
So move bitch, get out the way HOE

Middle finger to the law, nigga grippin my balls

All the ballers is bouncin they like the way I be leanin

All the rappers be hatin, off the track that I'm makin

But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it

Now fifty-two bars come it, now you feel 'em

Now, fifty-two cars roll out, remove ceiling

In case fifty-two broads come out, now you chillin

At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen

I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean

No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real

DOVE:
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Tell me, mirror, what is wrong?
Can it be my De La clothes
Or is it just my De La song?
What I do ain't make-beleive
People say I sit and try
But whan it comes to being De La
It's just me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

It's just me myself and I

POS:
Now you tease my Plug One style
And my Plug One spectacles
You say Plug One and Two are hippies
No, we're not, that's pure Plug bull
Always pushing that we've formed an image
There's no need to lie
When it comes to being Plug One
It's just me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

DOVE:
Proud, I'm proud of what I am

Poems I speak are Plug Two type
Please oh please let Plug Two be
Himself, not what you read or write
Right is wrong when hype is written
On the Soul, De La that is,
Style is surely our own thing
Not the false disguise of showbiz
De La Soul is from the soul
And this fact I can't deny
Strictly from the Dan called Stuckie
And from me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

POS:
Glory, glory hallelu

Glory for Plugs One and Two
But that glory's been denied
By kizids and dookie eyes
People think they dis my person
By stating I'm darkly pack
I know this so I point at Q-Tip
And he states, 'Black is Black'
Mirror mirror on the wall,
Shovel chestnuts in my path
Please keep on up with the nuts
So I don't get in aftermath
But if I do I'll calmly punch them
In the fourth day of July
'Cause they tried to mess with
Third degree, that's me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart

[Verse 2]
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art

[Bridge]
Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

[Verse 3]
But don't change your hair for me
Not if you care for me

[Ella]
Autumn in New York
Why does it seem so inviting
Autumn in New York
It spells the thrill of first-nighting

glittering crowds and shimmering clouds
In canyons of steel
They're making me feel - I'm home

It's autumn in New York
That brings the promise of new love
Autumn in New York
Is often mingled with pain

Dreamers with empty hands

They sigh for exotic lands

It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again

[Louis]
Autumn in New York
The gleaming rooftops at sundown
Oh, Autumn in New York
It lifts you up when you run down

Yes, jaded rou?s and gay divorc?es
Who lunch at the Ritz
Will tell you that it's divine

This autumn in New York
Transforms the slums into Mayfair
Oh, Autumn in New York

You'll need no castles in Spain

Yes, Lovers that bless the dark
On the benches in Central Park
Greet autumn in New York
It's good to live it again

[trumpet solo]

[Ella]

Oh, the shark, has, pretty teeth, dear....and he shows them, pearly white
Just a jackknife, has MacHeath, yeah.....and he keeps it, out of sight
When the shark bites, with his teeth, dear....scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves, though, wears MacHeath, yeah..so there's not a trace, hmmmm of red

On the sidewalk...Sunday morning, ...lies a body oozin' life
Someone's sneakin' 'round the corner...is the someone, Mack the Knife?

From a tugboat.... by the river..... a cement bag's, droopin' down

Yeah, the cement's just for the weight, dear...bet you Mack, he's back in town
Looky here Louie Miller, disappeared dear...after drawing, out his cash
And MacHeath spends, like a sailor...did our boy do, somethin' rash?

Sukey Tawdry, Jenny Diver..Lotte Lenya, Sweet Lucy Brown
Oh, the line forms on the right, dears.....now that Macky's back in town

Lullaby Of Birdland
That's what I'm
Always here when you sigh
Never in my wordland
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel
Have you ever heard two doves
Coo when they love
That's the kind of magic music
We make with our lips
When we kiss
And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'll cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell
And goodbye


Lullaby Of Birdland
Whisper low
Kiss me sweet
And we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky
Up Above
Oh Because we're in love

Lullaby Of Birdland
That's what I
Always here when you sigh
Never in my wordland
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel
Have you ever heard two tuttles doves
Bill and coo when they love

That's the kind of magic music
We make with our lips
When we kiss
And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I cried in my pillow
If You should tell me farewell

You'll fire your musket, but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand, there's no turning back
The bugle sounds, the charge begins
But on this battlefield, no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horses' breath
As I plunge on into certain death
The horse, he sweats with fear, we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near, yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day
We get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds take my horse below
And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone

In the great magnetic field
When he travelled time
For the future of mankind

Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

For Iron Man to spread fear

Avidity and lust controlled by hate.

Now your nightmare comes to life.

Dragged you down below
Down to the devils show
To be his guest forever
Peace of mind is less than never

Hate to twist your mind
But God ain't on your side
An old acquaintance severed
Burn the world your last endeavor

Flesh is burning
You can smell it in the air
Cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal (steal)


So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head
You're now a slave until the end of time here

Nothing stops the madness turning, haunting, yearning pull the trigger

You should have known
The price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here
Yeah
Oooooooh
It's your fucking nightmare
While your nightmare comes to life

Can't wake up in sweat
Cause it ain't over yet

Still dancing with your demons
Victim of your own creation

Beyond the will to fight
Where all that's wrong is right
Where hate don't need a reason
Loathing self-assassination

You've been lied to
Just to rape you of your sight
And now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel (feel)

So sedated as they medicate your brain
And while you slowly go insane they tell ya
""Given with the best intentions, help you with your complications""

The price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here

I feel the wind in my hair
And it's whispering, telling me things
Of the storm that is gathering here
Full of power I'm spreading my wings


Now I'm leaving my worries behind
Feel the freedom of body and mind
I have started my journey
I'm drifting away with the wind, I go

I am hunting high and low
Diving from the sky above
Looking for more and more once again
I'm hunting high and low

Sometimes I may win, sometimes I'll lose
Its just a game that I play


After the storm there's a calm
Through the clouds shines the ray of the sun
I am carried from all of my harm
There is no one that I can't outrun

I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them fall away

Mildewed and smoldering. Fundamental differing.

Pure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion

Disintegrating as it goes testing our communication

The light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so

We cannot see to reach an end crippling our communication.

I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them tumble down

No fault, none to blame it doesn't mean I don't desire to

Point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over.


To bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication

The poetry that comes from the squaring off between,

And the circling is worth it.

Finding beauty in the dissonance.

There was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away.

Mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting

I've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing

Doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication.

Cold silence has a tendency to atrophy any

Sense of compassion

Where bodies lie piled

Hides his emotions
His blood's running cold
Just like his victories

and where hell is six feet deep

So charge and attack

First off, let's take it from the start
Straight out, can't change what's in my heart
No one can tear my beliefs apart
You can't bring me
You ain't never seen no one like me
Prevail regardless what the cost might be
Power flows inside of me
You can't bring me
Never fall as long as I try
Refuse to be a part of your lie
Even if it means I die
You can't bring me
You can't bring me down

You wouldn't know what crazy was if Charles Manson
Was eating fruit loops on your front porch
Time out, let's get something clear
I speak more truth than you want to hear

You can't bring me
You ain't never seen so much might
Fight for what I know is right
What up? You got yourself a fight
You can't bring me
Stand up, we'll all sing along

Won't quit, we ain't in the wrong

Well, you can't bring me down
Just 'cause you don't understand what's going on
Don't mean it don't make no sense
And just 'cause you don't like it, don't mean it ain't no good
And let me tell you something
Before you go taking a walk in my world
You better take a look at the real world
'Cause this ain't no Mister Roger's neighborhood
Can you say, ""Feel like shit""?
Yeah, maybe sometimes I do feel like shit
I ain't happy 'bout it, but I'd rather feel like shit than be full of shit
And if I offended you, oh, I'm sorry, but maybe you need to be offended
But here's my apology, and one more thing
Fuck you!

Have despoiled our common grave
Now what necrophagous second coming
Backs from the cradle to enslave?
Sickle constellations
Stud the belts that welt the sky
Whilst the bitter winter moon
Prowls the clouds, dead-eyed
Shifting parent flesh, silk matricide
Watchful as she was upon eden
Where every rose arbour and orchard she swept
Hid the hissing of a serpent libido
In an ancient tryst with catastrophe
Soon hear that hissing now on the breeze
As through the plundered groves of the carnal garden
A fresh horror blows but ten billion souls
Are blind to see the rotting wood for the trees

As devils bay concenus for the space to piss

And the the mouldering face

Dance macabre 'neath the tilt of the zodiac
Now brighter stars shall reflect on our fate
What sick activities will be freed when those lights burn black?

I see the serpentine in your eyes
The nature of the beast as revelations arrive
Our screams shall trail to angels
Damned in flames repay
All sinners lose their lot on judgement day
We should have cut our losses as at calvary
But our hearts like heavy crosses held the vain belief
Salvation, like a promised nation
Gleamed a claim away
This is the end of everything you have ever known
Buried like vanquished reason
Death in season
Driven like the drifting snow
Peace, a fragile lover, left us fantasising war
On our knees or another fucker's shore
Heiling new flesh
To a crooked cross and a holy cause
What else be whipped to frenzy for?
This is the end of everything

Now they're clawing back
I smell their cumming as through webbed panes of meat
Led by hoary death, they never left

I awoke on impact
Under surveillance from the camera eye
Searching high and low
The criminal mind, found at the scene of the crime
Handcuffed and blind, I didn't do it
She said she loved me, I guess I never knew
But do we ever, ever really know?
She said she'd meet me on the other side
But I knew right then I'd never find her

[Chorus 1]
I don't believe in love
I never have, I never will
I don't believe in love
It's never worth the pain that you feel

[Verse 2]
No more nightmares, I've seen them all
From the day I was born, they've haunted my every move
Every open hand's there to push and shove
No time for love, it doesn't matter
She made a difference, I guess she had a way
Of making every night seem bright as day
Now I walk in shadows, never see the light
She must have lied 'cause she never said goodbye

[Chorus 2]
I don't believe in love
I never have, I never will
I don't believe in love
I'll just pretend she never was real
I don't believe in love
I need to forget her face, I see it still
I don't believe in love
It's never worth the pain that you feel

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge]
No chance for contact
There's no raison d'etre
My only hope is one day I'll forget
The pain of knowing what can never be
With or without love, it's all the same to me

[Chorus 3]
I don't believe in love
I never have, I never will
I don't believe in love
I'll just pretend she never was real
I don't believe in love

If the lines can be read between
Maybe you can tell me then what it all means

Locked down, I gotta get it out
Impending doom, a cloud above my head
Why me? My faith has been devout
Blasphemous? Am I better off dead?
Punishment, for all my sins
A burning thought inside my mind
Has me full of pity for all of human kind
As we move forth, we fall further behind
Fear of death, will my life go on?
Controlled fate? On the corner rolling dice
Punishment, but I've done nothing wrong
In my eyes, who really pays the price
My lament, for the human race
Guilty, punishment for all my sins
Dread the day that brings the truth
Punishment for what I've done
Sentence me for all my sins
Bound in fear for what I've got
Though not much it seems a lot
Life is death and no one wins
Bustin' my ass, another day another dollar, as I kneel down and I
Confess to the father that I'm suffering a burning question of
the truth, whether or not to pull the trigger or to jump right
off the roof, 'cause I did things normal and just like all my friends
but now I'm positive and life it all ends
Punishment, for all my sins, I repent
In reality, we all must face the fact that the majority
of the people are out there smoking crack, getting doped up,
shooting that shit into their veins, the question must be asked if
we have any brains left, or right or wrong in this son, a
question we all ask and must answer before long, 'cause no one
is safe in this world, what's the deal, the sentence is death and to
what court do I appeal?

Thrusts of pain increasingly engaged
Sensory receptors succumb
I am no one now only agony

My crimson liquid so frantically spilled
The ruby fluid of life unleashed

Ripples ascend to the surface of my eyes
Their red pens drawing at random, at will
A myriad pains begotten in their wake
The bastard spawn of a mutinous self

The regurgitation of my micro nemesis
Salivating red at the prospect of my ruin, my doom


Malfunction the means for its ascent
Bloodletting the stringent voice to beckon my soul
So futile any resisting tension
As death-induced mechanics propel its growth

The implement, the device of my extinction
The terminating clockwork of my gleeful bane
The definitive scourge of its mockery
The end-art instruments lethality attained

Heed - it commands, heed my will
Bleed - it says, bleed you will

Falling into the clarity of undoing
Scornful gods haggle for my soul
Minds eye flickers and vellicates as I let go

I don't wanna be a burden, I handle things defiantly

Faced with bad habits knowing it's a magnet to my imbalance
I'm somewhere between confidence and arrogance
The middle ground is treacherous, I work on getting out of it
Pops is looking down, I feel him every time the sun shine
Back to being unsigned
I only got my bloodline with me going forward

Heard you taking shots, we pulled up on 'em, they was gun shy

Grew quickly, blew sticky in the doohickey (Yuh)
Flu sickly, I could never need you wit' me
Please miss me wit' it if it got nothin’ to do wit' me

Really outside, what the fuck is you on?
You could never see me blowin' blunts out in Rio

I’m a livin' legend baby, I’m forever the G.O.A.T.?? ?
History won’t never find a nigga better to quote
You be on the type of sucka shit I'd never promote
I keep a ghetto brown queen, one hell of a throat
Like why they mad? I could peep it thru the halfway cheesin'
We'll be gettin' paper when it’s past they season
Told her all aboard, this the last train leavin'
Wake up every morning, treat it like ya last day breathin', I’m like

Please believe me, baby
Bought a Tesla, bought a Rolex watch and I ain't dreaming, baby
Scheming, maybe
Dena raised me
Really from the section with them killers, drug dealers, thug niggas
Never got a hug from Pops, they need some love, nigga
Liquor masking out the pain, so pour up, nigga
I'm not too far from it
Everything, I done seen and done it
Late-night running, hitting houses, and police cuffing
We ain't have nothing
House was cold, we would open oven
Now we eating good, just told Ice let's put buns in oven
Bakeries linked up with Quentin and started making cheese
Sushi Overseas, the server, she speaking Japanese
Flights to Paris, I'm at the Louvre to see Mona Lisa
Got out that Sonata with ripped seats and oil leaks
Kickin' shit like Messi, little nigga, you shouldn't test me
Write so good, just started working on my lefty
I'll be climbing up the charts if these niggas let me
Getting everything that's mine, I'm charging niggas levies
Fuck relaxing, man, I stay in action
Natural believer, got me feeling like Imagine Dragons

Made it hard to see family, I ran outta panic, I started to grind at the studio

Was wastin' that time that we coulda spent
Too focused, now foldin', I'm used to this
I'm not complainin', but shit to get hard
And I know what my worth is, I waited my turn

Nah
All of this ice in my veins
Lately, it feel like my mind is outta they range
I'm healin' to funnel the pain
Let me stop for a minute to see all the shit that we never did think we would see
We was just kids in the cul-de-sac
Bet I send the class with a giant heart
The memory caught in a photograph
I used to sit on the roof with my Daddy done, listen to trains go by
Then later, he told me he used to do things to numb out the feel of his brain on fire
Yeah
I'm not really sure what to say, 'cause the last time I seen him
His sister just passed, and I wasn't there, too busy, uh, they had me tweakin'
Addicted to people, perception of me
No niggas, they cast me as enemy
I used to wish I was current me
I'm excited to see who I'm finna be
I'm ready to grow to a better person, lookin' back, I'm already a better person
If you hate me, then hate me, so be it
First, let me give you the reason
Ayy
Wha-?

[Chorus]
Tryna keep my headspace clear
Been off the meds for the feels
Tryna run it up while I’m here
Really I am who I is
I went and became who they fear
She want me to be someone different (Burden is something from the past, you know?)
Ay, yeah
Tryna keep my headspace clear
Been off the meds for the feels
Tryna run it up while I'm here
Really I am who I is
Yeah

And I'ma need all of my dollars on corpus
So hand me the money I'll divie the pie

To build them a fortune on flipping the rye
I can't be mixy when iffy the vibe
And 40 on 50 it's really the time
Why are you all on my phone like you want me?
Like you wasn't pushing the kid to the side
I don't know if you bitches is thinking I'm blind
Cross all my crosses and dot all my i's
Done with your efforts
I'm dealing with pressures
I know it's a lesson

Trap through the app, make her clap it, no cappin', she tappin' in fast

Standin' six feet out, castin' a shadow of niggas

Skate off fast, put a buck on the dash, to somewhere vast, with my feet up, wait, hold up

They just cut the checks up, so I'm up, and it's lit
I take for Jake to they neck, they're like stretch

Niggas is different now, I was down dead, but that's all in the past tense
So I can't stop shit 'til I'm top ten and I'm not ten
I'm so in love with the process
Not all in a day, but it took 'em some time, that bill wrong
I just copped the crib, never home
No, I can't keep it charged on the phone
So she think she in love with a ghost
When I'm home, I'm make sure that she get what she need so she know what I'm capable of
Know my rhythm could spar with the pros, they pay to hear what I'm on, they ask what I'm on
I'm doin' great, I suppose
'Cause I get to do what I want, it's legit, but it sound like it's straight from the stove
They play in the field, and they treat me like I'm makin' plays in the fourth

I never switched sides, like
Even when I die, I'ma ride for the squad
Leather ties in the hurst
I've been in a vibe, kinda hard to describe
I'm in between ""I'm good"" and ""It's fine""
But I'm tired of the grind
Then I come alive in the night
To realize I'm in the middle of the time of my life
I'm never so packed for the stack
Never lied on a rap, got it back from the way that I ride it
Queen look enticing
Who that I survived, doing 80 to the house
Then I hit it to the sky
Changed, haters on a tirade
Talking to the crib and their face be still, like that hate stuff fade
We all want the same
We all want a mill and a safe, I want to live
Like I'm trying to enlighten it
Just build from my lips, feel
Bit from the bit, take a sip 'till I pass out
I'm trying to get grip, but it don't make sense
'Cause you can lose life on this fast route
Yeah, turned thoughts to a cash cow
I might flip that to the glass house
I don't need the accolades
I'm in love with the chase
I just want to eat, set a spot at the table
Beast with the slack, put myself on the map
You long with the wave, but we knowin' that it's cap
Five hour flights, couple nights at the flat
To be real, kept me seein' makin' moves where I'm at
I'm still on the grind last time? that I checked
Burning down the stage, keep the demons away
When I write to give a piece of myself to the page
I don't do it for the praise, love, this just ain't how I'm made
See the truth in the glass in the mirror Til', yeah
Threw it at me, old man tryin' to pass on the fear
You're the first one to talk, but the last one to hear
Eyes blurry, but I couldn't see the ass in the clear, damn
Start to feel like I'm on one
Start to land, I be for the long run
I'm a slave for the cash, got snakes in the grass
No brakes on that, but it's all fun
We done seen it all, heard it all
Heard enough, give me space before I murder y'all
Ten bad bitches here, I'ma curve 'em all
Twelve missed calls and I still made a curtain call
Here to light it up, lighten up
Here I'm talking ain't right enough, tighten up

I don't bank sets, I just bang on the set list
Don't pass up, but when I came for the breakfast
Put me in your prayers
I might put you on the guest list

See the drip, they see the glow up, oh now they know us

Smell the marijuana when I speed through

I flip my wrist, this shit a lay up, she wanna lay up

If I could live here forever, think it'd be for the better
I love the weather, even though it's fog 24/7
I love the people
This the city I met all my best friends
And I wanna thank every brick
I wanna thank every entrance to every building that I steppin' in this city of mine
Oh he most my best moments in life
See, I fell in love for the first time in Golden Gate Park
I saw my first rap show at Great American Hall
I used to beg my homies for a ride across the bridge to goof off
And spend the whole damn day doin' whatever we want
Keek drove us down to ice place while we'd roll up a blunt
And me and Jack would get stoney, walk around, and get lost
Don't think I'll ever pay back, although it's lucky to get
Just by walkin' through the city, know I'm a small part of this

I'm headed to the city where my chance to make it best
What, people like to give a little then you take the rest
I'm hopin' one day, maybe I can find a place to rest
I fell in love with life and wonder where it take me next
I like to hustle and bustle, I fell in love with the fashion

[Verse 1]
My life been lookin' gorgeous
Take one leg at a time, I pray I'll never have to force it
Got bad women for me, tell they man he need to forfeit
I'm standin' with the torch gripped in my hand, I'm hella condo of the palm, hold my fortune
I live ready to die, my momma hate me, soundin' morbid
Growin' up, my daddy got up in chasin' fortune
He'd probably be more proud if I was doctor or a lawyer, but I'm paid to be in line, we're only livin' in the moment
And I can't have my target, want me locked behind these bars, I'm in a spot that I can't conquer
Well, fuck it, 'cause we livin', my nigga
And I'm addicted to feelin' like I'm invincible, take the bag, then I triple it, the flow been on the pinnacle, vivid dreams of a miracle
Where I made it out of bond
Lately, I'm so out of mind, it's hard to wanna go outside, 'cause they've been killin' off my kind
But I've gotta hold my head and keep it loyal to the players, don't let 'em rob you want protection of yourself
Niggas lyin' for a check, I call it brobin' for the flex
'Til the label drop your ass, the bank collect on your advance
Tremble lightly 'cause the man don't give a fuck about your plan To see the world and feed your fam, the block is hot, it's hard as stain
I'm from the cove, my money talks, been on the low
They got the stoves, somehow the babies still ain't eatin' all they crabs stuck in the bucket tryna make it out the street shit
How we make it where we at, bitch trace the bloodline back to Eden
I'm a menace, a remnant of the pandemic, got the mask off, I'm flat jaw

They talk it foul but they Cap Lock
My heart is cold, keep it padlocked
My mind is cold, need it Kevlar
They sent the shot, but can't stick me
I dropped the ball in my lesson
I dropped the class with the schedule
I can't afford to be bored
Bet a couple of bros, made through the school with degrees
Can't lend the interview, they pay more than a minimum wage
They pull up suited, but they talkin' them 'bout the dreads on they head
In it be they resume, they can't say they name
That shit is shame
The system got it easy here, they claim she need to relax
Got a couple kids, a single mom, they laid her off back in March
She lost her crib, they sent the SWAT to throw her back to the street
That'd freeze her, writ the stimulus, won't even see her address
I'm thinkin' cash rules everything, they gotta spot a culture
Spend a couple of racks to keep the art scene postin'
When we ask for what we owe, they wanna talk like they ain't got it
Sign the next man at a lower rate to help 'em bag a fortune
So we torch it
We burn it all down 'til y'all get, bitch
I'm native to the sand, don't give a fuck about no pilgrim
When the Police snap my neck, my brother hangin' by a branch, and I can't even pay his bond, because we stretched a dollar thin
Tell me, how we supposed to win, huh?
They sellin' dope to keep us clothed, to pay the rent, huh?
A lot to hold, but I ain't fold, I'm still on ten, huh?
Toes planted in the soil, gettin' hard to keep it cultured, but that's just the way it go-

For him to come to California (Mmmm…)

Life of a legend, just a day in the life
Might slide on ya, I ain't stayin' the night
I ain't pick cards, I'm just playin' 'em right
Photo shoot tomorrow, they gon' play for the flight
Amazin' the height I'm able to reach from just rappin'
Get it all a jit, my nigga, so fuck trappin'
Catch me in the lab, I'm a player with the game plan
And I stick to it, we are really not the same, man
Nothin' make these motherfuckers change like the game can
In too deep, I'ma really be a name brand
I levitate, got you lookin' like a caveman
Talkin' like you winnin' doin' only what a slave can
I'm gettin' money so I'm knowin' why they mad at me
Quarter-ounce of literary, magic in the Glad baggie
Word to the plug, hope your baby stay fed, nigga
I'ma keep you livin' with a pocket full of dead niggas
And I came up from the eyes, they can't fathom
So I'ma need all my Lil' coins, you can't have 'em
But I'd probably drop a couple blessings on the way out
Give a Lil', get a Lil', watch it comma play out
Royal gettin' royalties, I'm waitin' on the pay out
Loyal to the soil, but we manifest the way out, uh
Thank God for the love and the upcomin'
I was blessed with the flows, got my cup runnin'
Ain't no fear in the black man, fuck runnin'

We was thirteen, playin' with a ratchet and some ratchet hoes
Side of town where niggas grow rapid, oh, we had to grow
On a need to know unless a motherfucka had to know
Posin' for the cameras like you tryna get a action role
I'm beneficial, you ain't beneficial to me, boy
Country bumpkin' Booney Boy, prayin' like a soon-ey boy
Say they wanna make a difference, they ain't movin' different, no
Passin' drugs with a handshake, that's a give and go
Lotta loud niggas from my hood, they ain't livin', no
Talkin' like he Jordan, a nigga ain't even Pippen, no
I hear the shit that you sayin', but put your chest in it
I'm the best in it, won't answer to nothin' less than it
I'm everything like your favorite rapper, but less timid
More organic, and less rented, I'm blessed with it
I got the shit that could shift minds with six lines
Tellin' tall tales, you 6'9'', my bitch fine
Catch a flight to the future, nigga, I switched times
Changed for the dolla, a bought a .40, you six dimes
Ghetto niggas who done moved to the 'burb side
Sippin' liquor curbside, now I'm makin' words ride
Better livin', I see this shit from a bird's eye
Learn to do my talkin' with numbers, I know the words lie
Highly favored, you fabricated and fictitious
I'm light bearin', I flick switches for quick riches
My shit vicious, come get stitches, it hit different
He hit my line 'cause his chick missin', no pic' flickin'
I'm dictatin', you dick ridin' and dick lickin'
Bickin' back big flickin', niggas know my shit kickin'
I said these niggas know my shit kickin'

And if I ever fall off, I could fall back
I could probably lose it all, get it all back
You waitin' on a white man in the call back
They ain't give it to us, we took it, now what you call that?
Thirty hours, five songs, I'm a hit maker
Fuckin' with the God body, you a risk taker
I'm overseas, you a overtime shift taker
All buildup, no action, these niggas cliffhangers
I quit stressin', I'm livin' my best life now
I can't fuck with these hoes, only my wife now
I leave the crib and she waitin' there in a nightgown
Fuck all of these haters, this wave makin' a lifestyle
Quarter-ounce of cookies, makin' crypto plays
Higher platform like a disco phase
With my same niggas from the Sisqo days
I'm out in Cali with the grower makin' Frisco plays
I miss those days when niggas was actually fact-droppin'
Go and tell the world real niggas is back poppin'
Rim still spinnin' as the lack stoppin', and I ragtop it, just so I'm seein' the backdroppin', nigga

Staying, playing with the boys

Is playing with the boys
Said it was the wrong thing

Between the walls I've built for myself right in my mind
And than you came over and you showed me love
That I never had seen before
And now when I got you it's all gonna be alright
Thinking 'bout all the things we did tonight
What a time to be alive
Just you and I
Just you and I
Only you can put my fire out
And you can turn it all around
And you can lift me off the ground
So we can fly again
So we can fly again
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
So we can fly again
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
So we can fly again
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
So we can fly again
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
So we can fly again
I've been trying hard not to go out of my mind
And all I need right now is for you to stay the night
But if you keep saying that you've got to leave
Then I'm gonna be alright
As long as you tell me that we ain't running out of time
Thinking 'bout all the things we did tonight
What a time to be alive
Just you and I
Just you and I
Only you can put my fire out
And you can turn it all around
And you can lift me off the ground
So we can fly again
