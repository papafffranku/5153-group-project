Beach towel rests on the dryin' line
Do I remind you of your daddy in his '88 Ford?
Labrador hangin' out the passenger door
The sand from your hair is blowin' in my eyes
Blame it on the beach, grown men don't cry
Do you remember that beat down basement couch?
I'd sing you my love songs and you'd tell me about
How your mama ran off and pawned her ring
I remember, I remember everything
A cold shoulder at closing time
You were begging me to stay 'til the sun rose
Strained words come on out
Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke
Pictures and passin' time
You only smile like that when you're drinking
I wish I didn't, but I do
Remember every moment on the nights with you
You're drinkin' everything to ease your mind
But when the hell are you gonna ease mine?
You're like concrete feet in the summer heat
It burns like hell when two souls meet
No, you'll never be the man that you always swore
But I'll remember you singin' in that '88 Ford
A cold shoulder at closing time
You were begging me to stay 'til the sun rose
Strained words come on out
Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke

Waiting for someone to turn her around
But she won't believe you
When you fall down on your knees
She fell asleep listening to my friends
Talking on and on about how the world ends
Then she wakes up
And climbs in my front seat

And she said
""Don't you wait to try it
Are you scared to find it?
And do you wanna take my broken heart?
Are you scared to start?""

Let's lay in the dead grass, stare at the stars
Run away and live out of cars and bars
Let's just leave here
'Cause there's nothing left to see
And if that's wrong, let's make it right
And if you leave, just give me one more night
'Cause there's no one
That you'll find that's quite like me

And she said
""Don't you wait to try it
Are you scared to find it?
And do you wanna take my broken heart?
Are you scared to start?""

You don't need the paycheck, don't need the rent
You can take it all 'cause it's already spent
We can burn out, just as long as we burn bright

And she said
""Don't you wait to try it
Are you scared to find it?
And do you wanna take my broken heart?
Will you ever heal from all these scars?
Did you ever take it all so far?
Are you scared to start?"""

I don't know much, but there's no weight at all

And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Somethin' in the orange tells me we're not done

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night

Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak

Out where the wild things are

He'd call me up every couple of weeks
From South California
Talk about the desert and the Joshua Tree
And his pretty girl stories
How he bought an Airstream trailer and a J-45 guitar
Said, ""Little brother, you'd love it out here
Out where the wild things are""

Oh, the nights ignite like gasoline
And light up those streets that never sleep when the sky goes dark

The second I made it
We started drinkin' on the strip in LA
And then it got crazy
Ended up at a house in the hills with some Hollywood stars
Kissin' on a blonde in a backyard pool
Out where the wild things are

Oh, yeah
Couple iron horse rebels
Wild as the devil
I knew I had to move back east
Said goodbye to my brother
At the end of that summer
But I knew he'd never leave

Oh, it's hearts on fire and crazy dreams
Oh, where the nights ignite like gasoline
And oh, them Indian Scouts, man, they're built for speed

As the masses scream the lyrics of the messed up kid
And then he told that old man he was never coming back
To be cut down again in a town like that

You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of the bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high

When she heard about my new found luck on that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now it just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me was my saving grace

It's got me thinking that her leaving is the only logical reason

That I got the last spot in the Hooter's parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club Raffle
Won a used four-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore

Rolls up when the wine is gone
Like a record on repeat
Leaning on old memories

My heartache in the night
With a kiss on her lips just like cyanide
Yeah she came with a warning
But I didn't mind

Whispers that she wants me
Try my best not to fall
When she falls into me

So, who the hell am I, who the hell am I
To expect a Savior, oh
If I only talk to God when I need a favor?
But God, I need a favor
Amen, amen
Amen, amen

Throwin' up prayers, like Hail Mary's
If You're still there, Lord, spare me
Oh my God, oh my God, Hail Mary
Hangin' in there, just barely
Throwin' up prayers, like Hail Mary's
If You're still there, Lord, spare me
Oh my God, oh my God, Hail Mary
I only talk to God when I need a favor
And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So tell me, who the hell am I to expect a Savior
When I only talk to God if I need a favor?
God, I need a favor
Amen

Hand on the bible, I'm a decent man
No, I ain't perfect but I'm learning
How to be the best I can
But I got demons collecting dust
And I've buried them so damn far down
So they can't find their way back up

So don't mistake my kindness for weakness
'Cause I can flip that switch
And you can find out quick

There's a hell on the other side
That you ain't met yet, tread real light
Dare you to light that fuse
'Cause I can be a loose cannon
Cross the line, I'll call your bluff
Promise when push come to shove
That you don't want that smoke
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

Go on, pull the trigger, try your luck
If you shoot your shot better pray to God
That I don't get my ass back up
'Cause you won't get your ass back up

There's a hell on the other side
That you ain't met yet, tread real light
Dare you to light that fuse
'Cause I can be a loose cannon
Cross the line, I'll call your bluff

When the life I've lived is reflected on my face
I sneak a peek at the mirror, and what I see is not bad
I relaxed my shoulders, to be upright
Dozens of given motivation
At the intersection connecting each neuron
I carefully assemble the meaning and reason of life
The driving distance of a lightning delivery ball
Whether it be short or long is up to each's decision
I no longer embrace bombs
I've passed the ball on to my crew
While I play catchball with my look-alike son on weekends
Metro on the outskirts
The metronome next to my childhood piano
Matching it became my job, and the payout keeps pilin' up
Still on thin ice
Anxiety about the future lurks beneath the stage like a ghost
I scream, shout, then come back
To relax with a bland home-cooked meal
Make some white noise

I'll tell you again
We'll never ever give up, forever
I'll say it again
We'll always be alive to move us
I'll tell you again
We'll never ever give up, forever

SEVENTEEN right here

I looked at the ground and kept going to the top and
Faced everything, like I'm so proud, I always win
It's key that you got a strong will (Strong will)
The future's not going anywhere, not until I let go

Da-rum-da-rim-da
Hop on our cloud and get all around (Hey)
Da-rum-da-rim-da
So that we can proudly stand tall (Hey)
Da-rum-da-rim-da
Let's move on to the next world, go
Catch this rhythm and flow

Say, say, say, say
Hero's true colors like this
A stance of being free of all time and space
If I give it my all and slip up
Don't know how to give up, I'm running riot

Feels like I turned into sonogong
Feels like I turned into sonogong
We'll never rest, every day, make it, make it
Don't break till we make it
Feels like I turned into sonogong

We already made it this high
I love my team, it's all thanks to you
Feels like I turned into sonogong

Listen up, we're on our way now (Now)
Switching up the generation till now (Now)
We're not stopping, we're racing now (Now)
Misstep or not, the backbeat still goes pow (Brr)
Oh, oh, pull up on my flying cloud
Oh, oh, be a hard worker now

Sometimes the truth hurts (What's that?)
Sometimes the lie's sweet (What's that?)
Sometimes kind's a kind of lie (What's that?)
Shove all the bad stuff together

Ping and out comes fire
Ener-energy, gather your strength and out comes power
Ener-energy, one massive shot

This morning, with bread in my mouth again
Start the day the same way
Ice Americano in one hand all day long
I'm so tired, I might die
Did I see this scene in the subway in your dream yesterday?
Oh, every day passes by, oh, oh

On a normal day in this busy life
Look at that kid

The peaceful sky collapsed
The dark before my eyes turn red
I think I forgot something
I feel like I'm going to cry for no reason
I think it would be better to just pass by
Because I just hate thinking

I lost the sense of concentration I had with caffeine
I feel like I'm going to throw up because I'm worried all day long
Even in the evening, I forget my hunger
It's weird, but you know what?

What should I say the first time I saw him? Do I miss it?
It's funny to me too

The peaceful sky collapsed
The dark before my eyes turn red
I think I forgot something
I feel like I'm going to cry for no reason
I think it would be better to just pass by
Because I just hate thinking

Know me for a long time
Make a sad face, oh-oh
Outside the memory without a trace
Or in the past, in the future, in another dimension, in the world
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

The peaceful sky collapsed
Even if the dark before my eyes turns red
I feel like I'm missing it again
I feel like I'm going to cry for no reason
I think it would be better to just pass by
Because I just hate thinking

No, I think it's better to pass by
Because I just hate it when I'm hurt"

Pour more out, gasoline on fire
Fly again, rising through the flames

Rude
Nude

[English translation:]

Why you think that 'bout nude
'Cause your view's so rude
Think outside the box
Then you'll like it

Hello my name is Yeppi Yeppi
Slightly dumb the way I talk, but I've got sexy, sexy figure
Well, for a tiara with a diamond
Did you think I'd just laugh as if, laugh as if

Twisted Lorelei that Don't need no man
A bookworm obsessed with philosophy, a Self-made woman
Very flabbergasted by this sassy Story
Audience booing and shouting ""You tricked me you're a liar""

Ah an undressed Movie star
Ah a night of broken starlight
Even if I look tacky or fall apart
Even if I'm not loved anymore

Yes I'm a nude
Nude ttattaratttara
Yes I'm a nude
Nude I don't give a love

Baby how do I look, how do I look
Put on my beautiful self and ttattaratttara
Baby how do I look, how do I look
Put on my beautiful self and ttattaratttara

(Ouch!)
Excusez-moi, to all of you who are sitting here
If you were expecting some rated R show
Oh I'm sorry, but that's not what we're showing
For Refund, see that direction,
Whatever people say is not my interest
You're welcome to throw those popcorns
Rating is just the inverse of bliss
But my climax, I feel sick
Of those prejudice made by themselves

Ah an undressed Movie star
Ah no more shameless night
Even if I look tacky or perhaps to you
Even if I'm not loved anymore

Yes I'm a nude
Nude ttattaratttara
Yes I'm a nude
Nude I don't give a love

Baby how do I look, how do I look
Put on my beautiful self and ttattaratttara
Baby how do I look, how do I look
Put on my beautiful self and ttattaratttara

Um ha um ha um ha um
Yes I'm a nude
Yes I'm a nude
Now I draw a luxury nude

Why you think that 'bout nude
'Cause your view's so rude
Think outside the box
Speak out

My beautiful self
My beautiful self
I'm born nude
You've got a dirty mind

Rude

Shake your head
Nothing stands in our way
Try to stop us
Unlock everything

We're still hungry
Because we're young
Move aside
'Cause we need some air
Untie everything that's been tangled up
Can't live life standing still

Bring back the microphone, raise the volume
Sit back and relax everybody
Feel it, this is our sound
Come on everybody

Slow it down, make it bouncy
Starting now, fly

Starting now, fly

Raise your head up to the sky
Front, back, side to side, listen to my words
S-O-N-G-M-I-N-G-I
Gonna know it's over (Ayy)
Where you're from, where you are, your age, religion, and even country
No boundaries, all of it, it doesn't matter
To the point of madness with crazy people
Shake it until you're about to overheat
Yeah, want it, want it and
Burn it, burn it, again let's play more
It's hot in here
Bounce up higher and higher
It's exploding, fly as far as you can
Gimme, it's a vibe snatch
Follow my dance or wave the white flag
Can't do that? It's a self-drag

Bring back the microphone, raise the volume
Sit back and relax everybody
Feel it, this is our sound

Slow it down, make it bouncy
Starting now, fly

BLACKPINK in your area

I crumbled before your eyes
Hit rock bottom and sunk deeper
To grab onto the last bit of hope
I've tried to reach out with both of my hands

Again in this dark place, light up the sky
While looking into your eyes, I'll kiss you goodbye
Laugh all you want while you still can
Because it's about to be your turn 1, 2, 3

Cock back the trigger

Don't like me? Then tell me how you like that, like that

In this even darker place shine like the stars
With a smile on my face I'll kiss you goodbye
Laugh all you want while you still can

Quiero tener tu fragancia conmigo
Y beberme de ti lo prohibido
Sabes que estoy colgando en tus manos
Así que no me dejes caer
Sabes que estoy colgando en tus manos
Te envío poemas de mi puño y letra
Te envío canciones de 4 40
Te envío las fotos cenando en Marbella
Y cuando estuvimos por Venezuela
Y así, así me recuerdes y tengas presente
Que mi corazón esta colgando en tus manos
Cuidado, cuidado (cuidado, mucho cuidado)
Marta yo te digo, me tienes en tus manos
Cuidado, mucho cuidado
No importa qué diga el destino, quédate conmigo
Cuidado, mucho cuidado
Lo quiero todo, verte y tus labios, tu cariño no prohibido, ay

I was supposed to be sent away
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say I hope you're okay
But you're the reason
And no one here's to blame
But what about your quiet treason?

And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Post Malone, Post Malone]
All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February
I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary
And I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, but I touched you

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

And for a fortnight there, we were together
Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors

E lo sai, l'amore non si può cantare in una strofa da otto

E comprerei per te la luna se c'avessi money
Solo per cantarti ancora un po'

I know you're not flossing your wrist like you been doing
The fact that I actually started to trust you
Then you broke my heart, someone bring me the tissues
Or maybe my notebook, I'll sharpen my pencil
To write you a letter, to show you I'm into you
Still down forever, even if it's pleasure
Go 'head, sign your name on the package I sent you
Open it up and when you get to cheesing
I hope you'd believe in the end that I got you

But that doesn't change that the way I've been feeling

'Cause all I see is the best of you and all you see is the best of me
And you bring out the best of me
And all I see is everything
Your goals, your glow, your inner being
And our bigger meaning

Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven
There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

Ooh, makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder

And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

Oh-oh-oh-oh-whoa

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed, now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

And it makes me wonder
Oh, whoa

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow? And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll

And she's buying a stairway to Heaven"

She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine.""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine.""
And still those voices are calling from far away

Many times I've lied and many times I've listened
Many times I've wondered how much there is to know
Many dreams come true, and some have silver linings
I live for my dream and a pocketful of gold

I wanna guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands 'cross my engines
Together we could break this trap

Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire?
'Cause, baby, I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I want to know if love is wild
Babe, I want to know if love is real
Oh, can you show me

Scream down the boulevard
Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark
Kids are huddled on the beach in the mist
I wanna die with you, Wendy, on the street tonight
In an everlasting kiss
The highway's jammed with broken heroes
On a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight
But there's no place left to hide
Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul

Just had to trust imagination

My friends would think I was a nut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut
So I went from day to day

Which connection I should cut
I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery

It means forever and that's a mighty long time

There's something else
The afterworld

A world of never-ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night

So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one Dr. Everything'll Be Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby

'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the afterworld
In this life
You're on your own

And if the elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy - punch a higher floor

If you don't like the world you're living in
Take a look around you
At least you got friends

You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
""Uh uh"" was all I heard

Are we gonna let the elevator
Bring us down
Oh, no let's go!

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!

We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause
We're all gonna die

And when we do (when we do)
What's it all for (what's it all for)
You better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door

Tell me, are we gonna let the elevator bring us down
Oh, no let's go!

Let's go crazy

'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!

In a noisy bar in Avalon I tried to call you
But on a midnight watch I realized why twice you ran away

Think about how many times I have fallen

When you see the Southern Cross for the first time
You understand now why you came this way
'Cause the truth you might be runnin' from is so small
But it's as big as the promise, the promise of a comin' day

So I'm sailing for tomorrow my dreams are a dyin'
And my love is an anchor tied to you tied with a silver chain
I have my ship and all her flags are a' flyin'
She is all that I have left and music is her name

For those who wish to seem
Those who wish to be, must put aside the alienation
Get on with the fascination
The real relation, the underlying theme
Living in a fisheye lens
Caught in the camera eye

I can't pretend a stranger is a long-awaited friend

We're breaking

Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love, give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

'Cause love's such an old-fashioned word
And love dares you to care for the people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves

Well, I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black
Back in the back
Of a Cadillac
Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
Yes, I'm in a bang
With a gang
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
'Cause I'm back on the track
And I'm beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So look at me now
I'm just makin' my play
Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way
'Cause I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black
Well, I'm back, yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Take my love
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah
Well, I'm back (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back
Back in black
Yes, I'm back in black
I've hit the sack"

And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be heroes, just for one day
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers, and that is that
Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time just for one day
We can be heroes for ever and ever
What d'you say?
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them, for ever and ever
Oh we can be Heroes, just for one day
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be Heroes, just for one day
We can be us, just for one day
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing, by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns, shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame, was on the other side
Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever
Then we could be Heroes, just for one day
We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
Just for one day
We can be Heroes
We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer, just for one day
Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-ohh, just for one day"

We're scanning the scene in the city tonight
We're looking for you to start up a fight
There's an evil feeling in our brains
But it's nothing new, you know it drives us insane
Running, on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying one thousand deaths
Running, on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying one thousand deaths
Come on now
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy (I see ya)
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
There is no escape and that's for sure
This is the end, we won't take anymore
Say goodbye to the world you live in
You've always been taking and now you're giving
Running, on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying one thousand deaths
Running, on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying one thousand deaths
Searching, seek and destroy (come on, everybody)
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Let's go, come on
Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
And it won't go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Don't try running away 'cause you're the one we will find
Running, on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying one thousand deaths
Running, on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying one thousand deaths
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, come on, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy (come on)
Searching, seek and destroy"
