Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February
I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary
And I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, but I touched you

Before I'd have to go be free?

The hurricane with my name when it came
I got drunk and I dared it to wash me away
Barricaded in the bathroom with a bottle of wine
Well, me and my ghosts, w? had a hell of a time
Yes, I'm haunt?d, but I'm feeling just fine
All my girls got their lace and their crimes
And your cheating husband disappeared, well
No one asks any questions here
So I did my best to lay to rest
All of the bodies that have ever been on my body
And in my mind, they sink into the swamp
Is that a bad thing to say in a song?

[Pre-Chorus: Florence Welch]
Little did you know your home's really only
The town you'll get arrested
So you pack your life away just to wait out

Tell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable
At least the dolls are beautiful, fuck me up, Florida

I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed
I felt aglow like this
Never before and never since

You and I go from one kiss to getting married
Still aliv?, killing time at the cem?tery
Never quite buried
In your suit and tie, in the nick of time

You Holy Ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life
You said I'm the love of your life
About a million times

Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate
And told me I reformed you?
When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes
Well, you took me to hell too

But I've felt a hole like this

You said I'm the love of your life

You shit-talked me under the table
Talkin' rings and talkin' cradles
I wish I could un-recall
How we almost had it all
Dancing phantoms on the terrace
Are they second-hand embarrassed
That I can't get out of bed
'Cause something counterfeit's dead?
It was legendary
It was momentary
It was unnecessary
Should've let it stay buried

Oh, what a valiant roar
What a bland goodbye
The coward claimed he was a lion
I'm combing through the braids of lies

You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me

I'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all said?

That I'll sue you if you step on my lawn
That I'm fearsome, and I'm wretched, and I'm wrong
Put narcotics into all of my songs

Rollin' thunder, he don't understand me
Splintered back in winter, silent dinners, bitter
He was with her in dreams
Gray and blue and fights and tunnels
Handcuffed to the spell I was under
For just one hour of sunshine
Years of labor, locks and ceilings
In the shade of how he was feelin'

Get the matches, toss the ashes off the ledge

I will never lose my baby again

Watched me daily disappearing
For just one glimpse of his smile
All those nights you kept me going
Swirled you into all of my poems
Now we're at the starting line, I did my time

To the house where you still wait up and that porch light gleams
To the one who says I'm the girl of his American Dreams

[Verse 2]
If karma's really real
How am I still here?
Just seems so unfair
I could be wrong though
If there's a point to being good
Then where's my reward?
The good die young and poor
I gave it all I could

[Pre-Chorus]
Stuck in this terradome (Ooh)
All I see is terrible (Ooh)
Making us hysterical (Ooh)
There's got to be more, got to be more
Sick of this head of mine (Ooh)
Intrusive thoughts, they paralyze (Ooh)
Nirvana's not as advertised (Ooh)
There's got to be more, been here before

[Chorus]
Ooh (Ooh, ooh)
Life's better on Saturn
Got to break this pattern
Of floating away
Ooh (Ooh, ooh)
Find something worth saving
It's all for the taking
I always say
[Post-Chorus]
I'll be better on Saturn
None of this matters
Dreaming of Saturn, oh

And it hits me

How you don't miss me
In The Black Dog
When someone plays 'The Starting Line' and you jump up
But she's too young to know this song
That was intertwined in the magic fabric of our dreaming
Old habits die screaming

I move through the world with the heartbroken
My longings stay unspoken
And I may never open up the way I did for you
And all of those best laid plans
You said I needed a brave man
Then proceeded to play him
Until I believed it too
And it kills me
I just don't understand

How you don't miss me
In the shower
And remember
How my rain-soaked body was shaking
Do you hate me?
Was it hazing?
For a cruel fraternity I pledged
And I still mean it
Old habits die screaming

Six weeks of breathing clean air
I still miss the smoke
Were you making fun of me with some esoteric joke?
Now I want to sell my house and set fire to all my clothes
And hire a priest to come and exorcise my demons
Even if I die screaming
And I hope you hear it

And I hope it's shitty
In The Black Dog
When someone plays The Starting Line and you jump up

Spread my wings like a parachute

Feeling like the very last drops of an ink pen

But I howl like a wolf at the moon
And I look unstable
Gathered with a coven 'round a sorceress' table
A greater woman has faith
But even statues crumble if they're made to wait

Spending my last coin so someone will tell me it'll be okay

We learned the right steps to different dances

Walking in circles like she was lost
Didn't you hear they called it all off

Silenced as the soul was leaving

Changed plans and lovers and outfits and rules

Too impaired by my youth
To know what to do

So if I sell my apartment
And you have some kids with an internet starlet
Will that make your memory fade from this scarlet maroon?
Like it never happened
Could it be enough to just float in your orbit?
Can we watch our phantoms like watching wild horses?
Cooler in theory, but not if you force it
To be, it just didn't happen

I built a legacy that you can't undo
But when I count the scars
There's a moment of truth
That there wouldn't be this
If there hadn't been you

And maybe you've reframed it
And in your mind you never beat my spirit black and blue
I don't think you've changed much
And so I changed your name and any real defining clues
And one day
Your kid comes home singing
A song that only us two is gonna know is about you

It was all for nothin'
