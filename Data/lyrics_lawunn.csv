Or, better yet, go to Times Square
Take a picture of me with a Kodak
Took my life from negative to positive
I just want y'all know that
And tonight, let's enjoy life

Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight

[Verse 1 â€” Pitbull:]
Take advantage of tonight
Cause tomorrow I'm off to Dubai to perform for a princess
But tonight, I can make you my queen
And make love to you endless
This is insane: the way the name growin'
Money keep flowin'
Hustlers move aside
So, I'm tiptoein', to keep flowin'
I got it locked up like Lindsay Lohan

Put it on my life, baby,
I make you feel right, baby
Can't promise tomorrow
But, I promise tonight
DalÃ©

[Pre-Chorus â€” Pitbull:]

And I might take you home with me, if I could tonight

Reach for the stars
And if you don't grab 'em,
At least you'll fall on top of the world
Think about it
Cause if you slip,
I'm gon' fall on top yo girl (hahaa)
What I'm involved with
Is deeper than the masons
Baby, baby, and it ain't no secret
My family's from Cuba
But I'm an American Idol
Get money like Seacrest

Put it on my life, baby
I make you feel right, baby
Can't promise tomorrow
But, I promise tonight

Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something

I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

See my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

So remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

So remember when we were driving driving in your car

City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving

So remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk

And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder

But it's I who pays the rent for these fingered-face out-of-tuners

Cause your queen of hearts who is half a stone
And likes to laugh alone is always threatening you with leaving

And give a medal to replace the son of Mrs. Annie Johnson

Cause they told me everybody's got to pay their dues
And I explained that I had overpaid them
So overdued I went to the company store
and the clerk there said that they had just been invaded
So I set sail in a teardrop and escaped beneath the doorsill

Cause I see my people trying to drown the sun
In weekends of whiskey sours

Dark and silent late last night, I think I might have heard the highway calling.
Geese in flight and dogs that bite.
And signs that might be omens say I'm going, going I'm gone to Carolina in my mind.

Now with a holy host of others standing round me, still I'm on the dark side of the moon.
And it seems like it goes on like this forever, you must forgive me
if I'm up and gone to Carolina in my mind.

In my mind I'm going to Carolina. Can't you see the sunshine, can't you just feel the moonshine?
Ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind? Yes, I'm gone to Carolina in my mind.

You can hear the boats go by 
You can spend the night beside her 
And you know that she's half crazy 
But that's why you want to be there 
And she feeds you tea and oranges 
That come all the way from China 
And just when you mean to tell her 
That you have no love to give her 
Then she gets you on her wavelength 
And she lets the river answer 
That you've always been her lover 
And you want to travel with her 
And you want to travel blind 
And you know that she will trust you 
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind. 
And Jesus was a sailor 
When he walked upon the water 
And he spent a long time watching 
From his lonely wooden tower 
And when he knew for certain 
Only drowning men could see him 
He said ""All men will be sailors then 
Until the sea shall free them"" 
But he himself was broken 
Long before the sky would open 
Forsaken, almost human 
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone 
And you want to travel with him 
And you want to travel blind 
And you think maybe you'll trust him 
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind. 

Now Suzanne takes your hand 
And she leads you to the river 
She is wearing rags and feathers 
From Salvation Army counters 
And the sun pours down like honey 
On our lady of the harbour 
And she shows you where to look 
Among the garbage and the flowers 
There are heroes in the seaweed 
There are children in the morning 
They are leaning out for love 
And they will lean that way forever 
While Suzanne holds the mirror 
And you want to travel with her 
And you want to travel blind 
And you know that you can trust her 
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind."

But I'm stuck here in the grass where the cold wind blows
Now, the liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
Well, there she goes, my friend, well she's rolling down at last

Hear the mighty engines roar - see the silver bird on high
She's away and westward bound - far above the clouds she'll fly
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines
She'll be flying o'er my home in about three hours time

This old airport's got me down - it's no earthly good to me
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground as cold and drunk as I can be

And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling
As the fog was lifting a voice was chanting

And on the sign it said ""No Trespassing""
But on the other side it didn't say nothing
That side was made for you and me

In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people
By the relief office I seen my people
As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking

There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name

In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la la la la, la la la, la la...

After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la la la la, la la la, la la...

After nine days I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with its life underground
And a perfect disguise all above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name

Feeling like a stranger nobody sees
So many things that we never will undo
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too

Some people will offer you their hand and some won't

I need something strong to distract my mind
I'm gonna look at you 'til my eyes go blind

I crossed that river just to be where you are

Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

Well my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free
I've got nothing but affection for all those who sailed with me

Everybody's moving, if they ain't already there
Everybody's got to move somewhere
Stick with me baby, stick with me anyhow
Things should start to get interesting right about now

My clothes are wet, tight on my skin
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine

Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long."

Illinois Central, Monday morning rail
15 cars and 15 restless riders
3 conductors, 25 sacks of mail

All along the southbound odyssey, the train pulls out of Kankakee
And rolls along past houses farms and fields
Passing trains that have no name, and freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles

Good morning America, how are you
Said don't you know me, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done

Dealing card games, with the old men in the club car
Penny a point ain't no one keeping score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels, rumblin' 'neath the floor

And the sons of Pullman porters, and the sons of engineers
Ride their fathers' magic carpets, made of steel
And mothers with their babes asleep, are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

Good morning America, how are you
Said don't you know me, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done

Nighttime on the City of New Orleans
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Halfway home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness, rolling down to the sea

But all the towns and people seem, to fade into a bad dream
And the steel rail still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his songs again, the passengers will please refrain
This train got the disappearing railroad blues

Good night America, how are you
Said don't you know me, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done"

I had a beer and now I hear you calling out for me
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.

Well the room is crowded, people everywhere
And I wonder, should I offer you a chair?
Well if you sit down with this old clown, take that frown and break it,
Before the evening's gone away, I think that we could make it,
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.

Well the night does funny things inside a man
These old tom-cat feelings you don't understand,
Well I turn around to look at you, you light a cigarette,
I wish I had the guts to bum one, but we've never met,
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.

I can see that you are lonesome just like me, and it being late,
You'd like some some company,
Well I turn around to look at you, and you look back at me,
The guy you're with has up and split, the chair next to you's free,
And I hope that you don't fall in love with me.

Now it's closing time, the music's fading out
Last call for drinks, I'll have another stout.
Well I turn around to look at you, you're nowhere to be found,
I search the place for your lost face, guess I'll have another round
And I think that I just fell in love with you."

If people stopped behaving strange
Smile at strangers, neighbours too
Lock those leaders in London's zoo!

It's God's Garden I'm looking to
Somewhere in there is me and there's you

And looking back down at me
Smiled reassuringly

We come on the ship that sailed the moon

And I was as wild, even wilder than they
For at least I could run, they just died in the sun
And I refused to just wither in place
Just a wild mountain rose needing freedom to grow
So I ran, fearing not where I'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
And the flowers I knew, in the fields where I grew
Were content to be lost in the crowd
They were common and close, I had no room for growth
And I wanted so much to branch out
So I uprooted myself from my home ground and left
Took my dreams and I took to the road
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
I grew up fast and wild and I never felt right
In a garden so different from me
I just never belonged, I just longed to be gone
So the garden one day set me free
I hitched a ride with the wind, and since he was my friend
I just let him decide where we'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
Just a wild rambling rose seeking misteries untold
No regret for the path that I chose
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive

That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear-skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth
And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say, ""Come dance with me""
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems
At seventeen
A brown eyed girl in hand-me-downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said, ""Pity, please, the ones who serve
They only get what they deserve""
And the rich-relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly
Remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality
And dubious integrity
Their small-town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received
At seventeen
To those of us who knew the pain
Of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
When dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me
We all play the game, and when we dare
To cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
They call and say, ""Come dance with me""
And murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me

Hot day, old orange juice and vodka on a night stand.
There's a Chevy Nova with the seat burned out the back
From a Winston cigarette that was sthumped into the window.
… Bobby Long was like Zorba the Greek,
Side-tracked by the scent of a woman.
Could've been an actor on the moviescreen,
Stayed in Alabama just a dreamer of dreams.
… He played football against W.S. Neil
Should've seen him running down the field.
I grow old, I grow old, I wear the bottoms of my
Trousers rolled.
It's a love song for Bobby Long.
A love song for Bobby Long.
… He was a handsome man, he had Cherokee cheeckbones.
A fair haired boy, where did he go wrong?
He chose the road less travelled, made all the difference.
Now he's chastized, criticized, he don't make no sense.
Brewton called him crazy, said Bobby Long was nothing but a drunk.
But all the thoughts in his head was way passed anything they done thunk.
It's a love song for Bobby Long.
A love song for Bobby Long.
… But don't get me wrong, Bobby Long wasn't no good.
He'd drag you down if he thought he could,
Well he would, drag you down.
The road I ride will be the death of me.
Won't you come along?
The road I ride is gonna set me free.
It's gonna take me home.
… He was a friend of my papa's he used to drink and tell lies.
Praised Flannery O'Connors, smoked cigarettes and philosophied.
So here I am at The Colonial Inn.
Me and Cap'n Long and my pretty girl-friend.
Well he charmes her with a poem, then he brakes down and cries,
Smiles a crooked smile, with his broken cheeck-bone side.
Tells about his life, now he's 63.
He looks me in the eyes and says come and go with me.
He could walk on water, walk on water,
But you know he drowned himself in wine.
God and the devil, God and the devil,
God and the devil along inside his mind.
It's a love song for Bobby Long.
A love song for Bobby Long."

And she's gone to Carter Hall as fast as go can she
She'd not pulled a double rose, a rose but only two

""And why come you to Carter Hall without command from me?""
""I'll come and go"", young Janet said, ""and ask no leave of thee""

Well, up then spoke her father dear and he spoke meek and mild
""Oh, and alas, Janet, "" he said, ""I think you go with child""
""Well, if that be so, "" Janet said, ""myself shall bear the blame
There's not a knight in all your hall shall get the baby's name

""The Queen of Faeries caught me when from my horse I fell
And at the end of seven years she pays a tithe to hell
I so fair and full of flesh and feared it be myself
But tonight is Hallowe'en and the faery folk ride
Those that would their true love win at Miles Cross they must buy
So first let past the horses black and then let past the brown
Quickly run to the white steed and pull the rider down
For I'll ride on the white steed, the nearest to the town
For I was an earthly knight, they give me that renown
Oh, they will turn me in your arms to a newt or a snake
But hold me tight and fear not, I am your baby's father
And they will turn me in your arms into a lion bold
But hold me tight and fear not and you will love your child
And they will turn me in your arms into a naked knight
But cloak me in your mantle and keep me out of sight""
In the middle of the night she heard the bridle ring
She heeded what he did say and young Tam Lin did win
Then up spoke the Faery Queen, an angry queen was she
Woe betide her ?ill-fought? face, an ill death may she die
""Oh, had I known, Tam Lin, "" she said, ""what this knight I did see
I have looked him in the eyes and turned him to a tree"""

And now you wear your skin like iron
And your breath as hard as kerosene
Weren't your mama's only boy
But her favorite one it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye
And sank into your dreams
Pancho was a bandit boy
His horse was fast as polished steel
He wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel
Pancho met his match you know
On the deserts down in Mexico
Nobody heard his dying words
Ah but that's the way it goes

They could have had him any day
They only let him slip away
Out of kindness, I suppose
Lefty, he can't sing the blues
All night long like he used to

Ended up in Lefty's mouth
The day they laid poor Pancho low
Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to go
There ain't nobody knows
All the Federales say
They could have had him any day
We only let him slip away
Out of kindness, I suppose

And Lefty's living in cheap hotels
The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold
And so the story ends we're told
Pancho needs your prayers it's true
But save a few for Lefty too
He only did what he had to do
And now he's growing old

Left its seeds while I was sleeping

Still remains

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a streetlamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools,"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sounds of silence."""

With an aching in my heart
And my pockets full of sand
I'm a long ways from home
And I miss my darling so
In the early morning rain
With no place to go
Out on runway number nine
Big 707 set to go
But I'm stuck here on the ground
Where the cold winds blow
Well the liquor tasted good
And the women were all fast
There she goes my friend
Oh she's rolling now at last
Here the mighty engines roar
See the silver wing on high
She's away and westward bound
High above the clouds she'll fly
Where the morning rain don't fall
And the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home
In about three hours time
This old airport's got me down
It's no earthly good to me
Cause I'm stuck here on the ground
Cold and drunk as I might be

Like you can a freight train
So I'd best be on my way

But when you die and go to heaven
You won't find no policemen there

I know your clothes are torn and ragged
And your hair is turning grey
Lift your head and smile at trouble
You'll find happiness some day

Beneath the tree where we once talked
Of an old couple burning
Their love letters so their children

And I'm puttin my shoulder to the wheel

I was taken by a photograph of you
There were one or two I know that you would have liked a little more
But they didn't show your spirit quite as true
You were turning around to see who was behind you
And I took your childish laughter by surprise
And at the moment that my camera happened to find you
There was just a trace of sorrow in your eyes
Now, the things that I remember seem so distant, so small
Though it hasn't really been that long a time
What I was seeing wasn't what was happening at all
Although for a while our path did seem to climb
When you see through love's illusions, there lies the danger
And your perfect lover just looks like a perfect fool
So you go running off in search of a perfect stranger
While the loneliness seems to spring from your life
Like a fountain from a pool
Fountain of sorrow, fountain of light
You've known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight
You've had to hide sometimes, but now you're all right
And it's good to see your smiling face tonight
Now, for you and me it may not be that hard to reach our dreams
But that magic feeling never seems to last
And while the future's there for anyone to change, still you know it seems
It would be easier sometimes to change the past
I'm just one or two years and a couple of changes behind you
In my lessons at love's pain and heartache school
Where if you feel too free, and you need something to remind you
There's this loneliness springing up from your life
Like a fountain from a pool
Fountain of sorrow, fountain of light
You've known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight
You've had to hide sometimes, but now you're all right
And it's good to see your smiling face tonight
Fountain of sorrow, fountain of light
You've known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight
You've had to struggle, you've had to fight
To keep understanding and compassion in sight (ahh-ah-ah-ah)
You could be laughing at me, you've got the right (ahh-ah-ah-ah)

Going to the candidates debate
Laugh about it, shout about it
When you've got to choose
Every way you look at this, you lose
Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?
Our nation turns its lonely eyes to you
Woo, woo, woo
What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson?
Joltin' Joe has left and gone away

Lord Donald's wife came into the church, the gospel for to hear
And when the meeting it was done, she cast her eyes about
And there she saw little Matty Groves, walking in the crowd
""Come home with me, little Matty Groves, come home with me tonight
Come home with me, little Matty Groves, and sleep with me till light""
""Oh, I can't come home, I won't come home and sleep with you tonight
By the rings on your fingers I can tell you are my master's wife""
""But if I am Lord Donald's wife, Lord Donald's not at home
He is out in the far cornfields bringing the yearlings home""
And a servant who was standing by and hearing what was said
He swore Lord Donald he would know before the sun would set
And in his hurry to carry the news, he bent his breast and ran
And when he came to the broad millstream, he took off his shoes and he swam
Little Matty Groves, he lay down and took a little sleep
When he awoke, Lord Donald was standing at his feet
Saying ""How do you like my feather bed and how do you like my sheets
How do you like my lady who lies in your arms asleep?""
""Oh, well I like your feather bed and well I like your sheets
But better I like your lady gay who lies in my arms asleep""
""Well, get up, get up, "" Lord Donald cried, ""get up as quick as you can
It'll never be said in fair England that I slew a naked man""
""Oh, I can't get up, I won't get up, I can't get up for my life
For you have two long beaten swords and I not a pocket knife""
""Well it's true I have two beaten swords and they cost me deep in the purse
But you will have the better of them and I will have the worse
And you will strike the very first blow and strike it like a man
I will strike the very next blow and I'll kill you if I can""
So Matty struck the very first blow and he hurt Lord Donald sore
Lord Donald struck the very next blow and Matty struck no more
And then Lord Donald took his wife and he sat her on his knee
Saying ""Who do you like the best of us, Matty Groves or me?""
And then up spoke his own dear wife, never heard to speak so free
""I'd rather a kiss from dead Matty's lips than you or your finery""
Lord Donald he jumped up and loudly he did bawl
He struck his wife right through the heart and pinned her against the wall
""A grave, a grave, "" Lord Donald cried, ""to put these lovers in
But bury my lady at the top for she was of noble kin"""

Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles
Such are promises
All lies and jest
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest
When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

And wishing I was gone, going home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me, going home
In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving""
But the fighter still remains

Yeah nigga, I'm still fuckin with ya
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D-R-E, '99 Nigga (Guess who's back)
Still, still doing that shit, Andre?

[Dr. Dre]
Oh for sho', check me out
It's still Dre Day nigga, A.K. nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off

How nigga? My last album was ""The Chronic"" (nigga)
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it

[Snoop]
If you ain't up on thangs

[Dr. Dre]
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still, puffing my leafs, still fuck with the beats
Still not loving police (Uh huh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (fo sho)
Still got love for the streets, repping 213 (fo life)

Still the beats bang, still doing my thang
Since I left, ain't too much changed, still

[Snoop]
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl

[Dr. Dre]
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E 

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl


Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth

It's ""Turn Out the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, After-mathematics
In the home of drivebys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E

[Snoop]
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

It ain't nothing but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're cooling on a corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representing for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap

Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back

[Snoop]
So if you ain't up on thangs

[Dr. Dre]
Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still, got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world

Ya, let's take em back
Uh huh

Comin up I was confused my momma kissin a girl
Confusion occurs comin up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around probably out commitin felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing ch-check out my melody
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope for a fo-finger ring
One of them gold ropes 
NaNa told me if I pass could get a sheep skin coat 
If I can move a few packs and get the hat, now that'd be dope

Tossed and turned in my sleep that night 
Woke up the next morning niggas done stole my bike
Different day same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

[Chorus (50 then Game):]
Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop

Go head' envy me
I'm raps MVP
And I ain't goin nowhere so you can get to know me

Hate it or love it the underdog's on top

And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop

Go head' envy me
I'm raps MVP
And I ain't goin nowhere so you can get to know me

[Game]
On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides right above the gold wires
I'll fo-five em
Kill a nigga on my song but really do it
Thats the true meaning of a ~ghostwriter~
10 g'z will take ya daughter out of Air Forces
Believe you me homie i know all bout losses
I'm from Compton where the wrong colors be cautious
One phone call will have ya body dumped in Marcy

I stay strapped like car seats
Been bangin since my lil nigga Rob got killed for his Barkley's
That's 10 years I told Pooh in 95' I'd kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95s
Told Banks when i met him imma ride 
And if I gotta die rather homicide 
I ain't have 50 Cent when my Grandmomma died
Now i'm goin back to Cali with my Jacob on
See how time fly?

[Chorus - 50 Cent]

From the beginnin to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in
Is full of pressure and pain

Enough of me nigga now listen to Game

[Game]
Used to see 5-0 throw the crack by the bench
Now i'm fuckin with ~5-0~ it's all startin to make ~sense~
My moms happy she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waitin on Sha Money to land sittin in the Range
Thinkin how they spend 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin
Pac is gone and Brendas still throwin babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's goin on like i hear Marvin
No school books they use that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and i get exhausted 

I think what if Marie Banker got that abortion
I love ya Ma'

Do it better than anybody ya ever seen do it

Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it

I guess every superhero need his theme music

No one man should have all that power

The clock's tickin', I just count the hours

Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power

21st century schizoid man

The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open

We ain't got nothin' to lose, motherfucker, we rollin'

Huh? Motherfucker, we rollin'

With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands


In this white man world, we the ones chosen

So goodnight, cruel world, I see you in the mornin'

Huh? I see you in the mornin'

This is way too much, I need a moment

No one man should have all that power

The clock's tickin', I just count the hours

Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power

'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours

And then they, and then they

And then they, and then they

And then they, and then they

21st century schizoid man

Fuck SNL and the whole cast

Tell 'em Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass

More specifically, they can kiss my asshole

I'm an asshole? You niggas got jugs

You short minded niggas' thoughts is Napoleon


My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the Dodies in

Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic

He knows, he's so fuckin' gifted

I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts

Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault

My childlike creativity, purity and honesty

Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts

Reality is catchin' up with me

Takin' my inner child, I'm fighting for it, custody

With these responsibilities that they entrusted me

As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece

Thinkin' no one man should have all that power

The clock's tickin', I just count the hours

Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the powder

'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours

And then they, and then they


And then they, and then they

And then they, and then they

21st century schizoid man

Holy powers, Austin Powers

Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation

They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation

Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation

At the end of day, goddammit, I'm killin' this shit

I know damn well y'all feelin' this shit

I don't need yo' pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick

I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?

How Ye doin'? I'm survivin'

I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'

Where the bad bitches, huh? Where ya hidin'?

I got the power, make yo' life so excitin'

(So excitin')


Now this'll be a beautiful death

I'm jumpin' out the window

I'm lettin' everything go

I'm lettin' everything go

This'll be a beautiful death

I'm jumpin' out the window

I'm lettin' everything go

I'm lettin' everything go

Now this'll be a beautiful death

Jumpin' out the window

Lettin' everything go

Lettin' everything go

You got the power to let power come

Nigga lets go half on a sack!
I take a sack to the face whenever I can
Fuck a crutch; I be smoking that shit
Til the joint be burning my hand
Next time I roll it in a Tampa
To burn slow so the ashes won't be burning up my hand, brah
Hoes want to hit but they know they got to pitch in
Then, I roll a joint that's longer than your extension
Cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free
Fuck that, you better bring your own shit chief
Wassup, don't babysit that
You better pass the joint
Nigga stop hitting cause you know you got asthma
Crack a 40 open homie and guzzle it
Cause I know the weed in my system is getting lonely
I gotta take a piss test for my P.O
I know I failed cause I done smoked hella weed, bro
An every time we with Chris
That nigga rollin' up a fatty
But the Tanqueray straight had me
Lit to the fullest extreme
There was getting no higher
That shit had my chest on fire
Dru Down was swigging to the face straight
But I ain't fuckin with that
I think I'll stick to the crazy 8's
Bring me a bottle and I'm cool with that
I'mma a lounge with that
Nigga bring me a phat sack
I don't know how to roll
But I know how to smoke!
I think I'm gonna hit it til my ass choke
I got 5 on it
Grab your 40, let's get keyed
I got 5 on it
Fuckin with that Indo weed
I got 5 on it
It's got me stuck and I'm tore back
I got 5 on it
Nigga lets go half on a sack!
Player, give me some brew and I might just chill
But I'm the type that likes to light another joint like Cypress Hill
I steal doobies, spit loogies when I puff on it
I got some bucks on it
But it ain't enough on it
Fuck with the S the T, I-D-E-S
Nevertheless I'm hella fresh
Rolling joints like a cigarette
So pass it cross the table like ping-pong
I'm gone, beating my chest like King Kong
It's on, wrap my lips around a 40
And when it comes to get another stogie
Niggas all kick in like Shinobi
Nummy ain't my homie to begin with
It's too many heads to be popping to let my friend hit shit
Unless you pull out the phat crispy
5 dollar bill on the real before its history
Cause niggas be having them vacuum lungs
An if you let em hit it for free
You hella dum-da-dum-dum!
I come to school with the Taylor on my earlobe
Avoiding all the dick-teasers
Skeezers and weirdos
That be fuckin' off the land like ""Where tha bomb at?""
Give me 2 bucks, you take a puff and pass my bomb back
Suck up the dank like a Slurpee
The serious bomb will make a nigga go delirious like Eddie Murphy
I got more Growing Pains than Maggie
Cause niggas nag me
To take the dank out of the baggie
I got 5 on it
Grab your 40, let's get keyed
I got 5 on it
Fuckin with that Indo weed
I got 5 on it
It's got me stuck and I'm tore back
I got 5 on it

And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Drake]
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with

Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came

And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back

Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap

Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk

Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

[Eminem]
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'

Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

Regulators, mount up!

[Warren G & Nate Dogg]
It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets tryin' to consume
Some skirts for the eve so I can get some funk
Rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone
Just hit the east side of the LBC
On a mission tryna find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213
So, I hooks a left on 21 and Lewis

Some brothers shootin' dice, so I said ""Let's do this!""
I jumped out the ride and said ""What's up?""
Some brothers pulled some gats, so I said ""I'm stuck!""
Since these girls peepin' me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Onto bigger, better things than some horny tricks
I see my homie and some suckas all in his mix

[Warren G & Nate Dogg]
I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they takin' Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brothers, said ""Damn, what's next?""

They got my homie hemmed up and they all around
Can't none of them see him if they goin' straight pound-for-pound
They wanna come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them bustas down
They got guns to my head, I think I'm goin' down
I can't believe it's happenin' in my own town
If I had wings I would fly, let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homie Nate
Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin', it's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate

[Nate Dogg & Warren G]
I laid all them bustas down, I let my gat explode

Now I'm switchin' my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts, sit back and observe
I just left a gang of hoes over there on the curb
Now, Nate got the freaks and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up, back up, 'cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me, the Warren to the G
Just like I thought, they were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
But Nate Dogg and the G child
Were in need of somethin' else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said, ""Ooh, I like your size!""
She said, ""My car's broke down and you seem real nice
Would you let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's goin' real swell

The next stop is the Eastside Motel

[ Warren G & Nate Dogg]
I'm tweaking into a whole new era
G-funk, step to this, I dare ya
Funk on a whole new level
The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble
Chords, strings, we brings melody, G-funk
Where rhythm is life and life is rhythm
If you know like I know, you don't wanna step to this
It's the G-funk era, funked out with a gangsta twist
If you smoke like I smoke, then you're high like every day
And if yo' ass is a busta, 213 will regulate"

You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless
Where restless (Niggas) might snatch your necklace
And next these (Niggas) might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these (Niggas) who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless *gasps*
Try to catch it *gasps* it's kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method
They be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
Sayin' ""We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast""
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis
My mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well mama I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move
I hope

God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus, walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus, walk)
And I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs

To the victims of welfare feel we livin' in Hell here, hell yeah

Now, hear ye, hear ye, want to see Thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models: we rap, we don't think
I ain't here to argue about His facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single, dawg, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?
Well if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' about
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out

So follow, it's Showtime at the Apollo minus the Kiki Shepards
What about a ho in a leopard-print? Ah

Lauryn Hill),Nas,"Intro: Nas (Lauryn Hill singing in the background)

Life..... I wonder....
Will it take me under.... I don't know

Verse One: Nas

Imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassin
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle cruising blue behind my waters
No welfare supporters more conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra

The world's hot my son got knocked evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage we'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashin, fashion
Designer clothes, lacing your click up with diamond rolls
Your people holdin dough, no parole
No rubbers, go in raw imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""

Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Nas

If I ruled the world Imagine that

I'd free all my sons, I love em love em baby
Black diamonds and pearls Could it be, if you could 
be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world Still livin for today, in
these last days and times

Verse Two: Nas

It'd be, paradise, life, relaxin black, latino and anglo-saxon
Armani exchange the range
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash then we laugh in the iller path

The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years in depression make me vision
The better livin, type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controlling, click rollin
Trickin six digits on kicks and still holdin
Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage
Gimme one shot I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisonners set free, stress free 
No work release purple M3's and jet skis 
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities and reverse fiends to Willies

It sounds foul but every girl I meet would go downtown
I'd open every cell in Attica send em to Africa

Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Nas

If I ruled the world Imagine that
I'd free all my sons, I love em love em baby
Black diamonds and pearls Could it be, if you could 
be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world Still livin for today, in
these last days and times


And then we'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land
We'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

Verse Three: Nas

You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Runnin from Jake, gettin chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks many mistakes go down out of state
Wait, I had to let it marinate we carry weight

Tryin to get laced, flip the ace stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Makin moves in Atlanta, back and forth scrambler
Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still nobody wants 2 see a nigga havin shit
But if I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I push the Q-45 Infinit
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or Beef Felonies
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck???

Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Nas


If I ruled the world Imagine that
I'd free all my sons, I love em em baby
Black diamonds and pearls Could it be, if you could 
be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world Still livin for today, in
these last days and times

If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled Imagine that
I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled
I love em love em baby
Black diamonds and pearls, black dimaonds Could it be, if you could

black diamonds be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world Still livin for today, in
these last days and times

If I ruled the world, if I ruled
if I ruled, I'd free all my sons
black diamonds, I love em love em baby
Black diamonds and pearls, if I ruled
If I ruled the world

If I ruled the world
I love em love em baby!!"

You can find me, in St. Louis rollin' on dubs
Smokin' on dubs in clubs, blowin' up like cocoa puffs
Sippin' Bud, gettin' perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs
And it's all because, 'ccumulated enough scratch
Just to navigate it, wood decorated on chrome
And it's candy painted, fans fainted, while I'm entertainin'
Wild ain't it? How me and money end up hangin'
I hang with Hannibal Lector (hot shit) so feel me when I bring it
Sing it loud (what?)
I'm from the Lou and I'm proud
Run a mile for the cause, I'm righteous above the law
Playa my style's raw, I'm ""Born to Mack"" like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame, and the glamour
Give me D's with a rubber hammer

Ready for action, nip it in the bud.
We never relaxin?, OutKast is everlastin?
Not clashin?, not at all 
But see my nigga went to do a little actin?
Now that?s for anyone askin? 
Give me one, pass em?
Drip, drip, drop... There goes an eargasm
Now you cumin? out the side of your face
We tappin? right into your memory banks (Thanks)
So click-it or ticket, let?s see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattlin?, like two midgets in the back seat wrestlin?

Speakerbo??? vibrate the tag 
Make it sound like aluminum cans in the back
(Pre-Chorus):
But I know y?all wanted that 808/ Can you feel that B-A-S-S, bass
But I know y?all wanted that 808/ Can you feel that B-A-S-S, bass

I love the way, I love the way.

I love the way you move
I love the way you move (Woooo)
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way.


(Verse 2) [Big Boi]
The whole room fell silent, (Shhhhh!) the girls all paused with glee 
Turnin? left, turning right are they lookin? at me?
Well I was looking at them, there, there on the dance floor
Now, they got me in the middle feelin? like a man-whore
Especially the big girl, big girls need love too 
No discrimination here, squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
Let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak!
Skinny, slim women got the camel-toe within ?em 
You can hump them, lift them, bend them, give them something to remember

Yell out ?timber? when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep a breath and exhale 
Your ex-male friend, boyfriend was boring as hell
Well let me listen to the story you tell 
And we can make moves like a person in jail... on the low, hoe!

[Chorus]

[Sleepy Brown]
Hey baby, girl don?t you stop it
Come on lady, dance all around me 
You look so fine, look so fine 
Drive me out of my mind, out of my mind, out of my mind (Aawww baby!)
If I could, I would just leave with you, baby
Oooooh, ?cause you light me and excite me 

And you know you got me, baby (Wooooo!)

(Chorus and Out)
I like the way you move (I like the way you move)
I like the way you move (Oooh, so sexy baaby!) (Woooo)
I love the way you move 
I love the way, I love the way. (Woooo)

I love the way you move (I love the way you move)
I love the way you move (Oooh, you so sexy baby) (Woooo)
I love the way you move 
I love the way, I love the way.

I like the way you move

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
If I can't do it, homie
It can't be done
Now I'ma let the champagne bottle pop, I'ma take it to the top
For sure, I'ma make it hot, baby (Baby)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I apply pressure to pussies, they stunt and I pop (Yeah)
Stand alone squeezing my pistol, I'm sure that I got 'em (Uh-huh)
Now, Peter Piper picked peppers, and Run rocked rhymes
I'm 50 Cent, I write a little bit, but I pop nines (Brrat)
Tell niggas get they money right, 'cause I got mine (Uh-huh)
And I'm around, quit playing, nigga, you can't shine (Woo)
You gon' be that next chump to end up in the trunk
After being hit by the pump, is that what you want?
Be easy, nigga, I'll lay your ass out
Believe me, nigga, that's what I'm about
Gangsta, you could find a nigga sitting on chrome
Hit the clutch, hit the gear, hit the gas and I'm gone (Yeah)

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
If I can't do it, homie
It can't be done
Now, I'ma let the champagne bottle pop, I'ma take it to the top

[Verse 2: 50 Cent & Dr. Dre]
I'm down for the action, he smart with his mouth, so smack him (Woo)
You holding a strap, he might come back, so clap him (Yeah)
React like a gangsta, or die like a gangsta for acting (C'mon)
'Cause you'll get hit and homicide'll be asking, ""What happened?""
Oh no, look who crept in with the .44
Twenty-inch rims sitting on low-pros (Uh-huh)
East side, west side, niggas know, yo, I'm loco (Yeah)
Even my mama said something really wrong with my brain
Niggas don't rob me, they know I'm down to die for my chain
G-Unit (Yeah), we get it popping in the hood
G-Unit (Yeah), motherfucker, what's good?
I'm waiting on niggas to act like they don't know how to act (Uh-huh)
After sippin' too much Jack, I'll blow 'em off the map
With the MAC, thinking it's all rap
'Til that ass get clapped and Doc say, ""It's a wrap"" (It's a wrap, nigga)

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
I invented how to teach lessons to slow learners
Go ahead, act up, get smacked in the head with the burner (Ah)
I don't fight fair, I'm dirty, dirty
I'm from Southside Jamaica, Queens, nigga, you heard me? (Yeah)
When the streetlights come on, niggas blast the nines (Uh-huh)
Get locked up, then read books to pass the time (Woo)
In the game, there's ups and downs, so I stay on the grind
Niggas on my dick more than my bitch, I stay on they mind
There ain't nothing they could do to stop my shine (Uh-uh)
This is God's plan, homie, this ain't mine
I played the music loud so Grandpa called me a nuisance
And Grandma always gotta throw in her two cents
I'm the dropout who made more money than his teachers
Roofless like the coupe, but I come with more features
I am what I am, you can like it or love it
It feels good to blow fifty grand and think nothing of it, fuck it

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
If I can't do it, homie

Jigga, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah
Let it bump though
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life
From standin' on the corners boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
For droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock fleein' the murder scene
You know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all n- know me to fail? F- naw
Where all my n- with the rubber grips, bust shots?
And if you with me, mom, I rub on your -, and what-not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it 50-50, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my n- Biggie, baby
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter, n-, Volume 2
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life
I flow for those 'dro'ed out
All my n- locked down in the 10 by 4, controllin' the house
We live in hard knocks, we don't take over, we borrow blocks
Burn 'em down and you can have it back, daddy, I'd rather that
I flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition
I see your vision mama, I put my money on the longshots
All my ballers that's born to clock
Know I'ma be on top whether I perform or not
I went from lukewarm to hot, sleepin' on futons and cots
To King size, green machines, to green 5's
I've seen pies, let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down type braille
I'm tight grill with the phony, rappers y'all might feel we homies
I'm like still, y'all don't know me, sh-
I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin'
I'm tryna murder everything movin', feel me
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life
I don't know how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes
Got a lot of beef, so logically, I prey on my foes
Hustling's still inside of me, and as far as progress
You'd be hard-pressed to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out
Didn't really appreciate it 'til the second one came out
So I stretched the game out, etched your name out
Put Jigga on top, and drop albums non-stop for ya, n-
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life
It's the hard knock life
It's the hard knock life"

Wrist glist now 'cause I make a gang of cash
Light glance, still street with the doo-rag
Slang, spit game, change speech, how they do that? Huh
Watch they mouths drop, watch the crowds pop up and act out
Broads with the screw face, smash on and knock out
Ain't changed, game don't run me, I run the game
If I gotta keep it gritty, so be it, I'm supposed to change
Like simple, dizzy broads ain't fuckin' with my mental
Natural born hustlin' bitch, check what I've been through
Got mine, took it from you, and now you slot mine
Exec to my own shit, dawg I'm ownin' dot coms
Who's that girl? C'mon, c'mon
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Eve's that girl, uh, yo, yo, yo

Thought I did it one way, ain't prepared for me
Huh, mad 'cause an image, I don't care to be
Realness, real shit, spit reality
Attitude rude, that's the Philly in I
Need me in the game, I'm the thrill in your life
Breath of fresh air
Little boys hang me on their wall, I grow 'em chest hair
Why you listenin' to other shit? You got the best here
Come on try your luck, shorty, I got the rest scared
Bet you anything you ain't ready and you get left there
Ain't known for frontin', vouch for my behavior
Same way they get down, I get down for this paper
16 lean from my pen so you can test her
Still need to know who I am, then cop the record
Take it like a class on me and learn the lesson
Bottom line, my world, my way, any questions?
Who's that girl? Uh, c'mon, c'mon
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)

Power moves is made everyday by this thorough bitch
I'ma get this bank anyway that I do this shit
I was born to shine, and most of y'all's borderline bullshit
Know exactly what I want from me, you cats is clueless
Dispose the flow through my hands like water
Heat starts growing from my son or my daughter
Eve want her own cash, fuck what you bought her
He spend, you owe, that's what mommy taught her
So hardball is played, won't starve today
Song after song I write so I get paid
Thought I wasn't followin' up with the second round
Now bitch, swallow it up while I shove it down
Make 'em love me over again and over your name
Betcha they get over your style and over your fame
Why you lookin' sad at me? I ain't to blame
Back to plan B, baby, I can feel your pain
Who's that girl? E-V-E, y'all, uh, uh, now say my name, y'all
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)

Hey you, sittin' over there (say what?)
You better get up out of your chair (that's right)
And work your body down (yeah)
No time to funk around 'cause we gon'
Funk you right on up
So get up, get a move on, and get your groove on
It's the D-R-E the spectacular
In a party, I go for your neck so call me ""Blacula""
As I drain a nigga's jugular vein
And maintain to leave blood stains so don't complain
Just chill, listen to the beats I spill
Keepin' it real, enables me to make another meal
Still, niggas run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple, so call me Clearasil
I wipe niggas off the face of the Earth since birth
I been a bad nigga, now let me tell you what I'm worth
More than a stealth bomber, I cause drama
The enforcer, music flows like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet, never forget
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes panties wet
The mic gets smoked, once you hear the beat kick
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E, I keep their motherfuckin' heads ringin'
Keep their heads ringin'
(Ring, ding-dong, ring-a-ding, ding, ding-dong)
One, two for the crew, three, four for the dough
Five for the hoes, six, seven, eight for Death Row
Mad niggas about to feel the full effect of intellect
So I can collect respect, plus a check
Now, I fin' to, get into to my mental
Will take care of this business, I need to attend to 'cause my rent's due
And this rap shit's my meal ticket
So you goddamn right I'ma kick it, or get evicted
I bring terror like Stephen King
A black Casanova, runnin' nigga over like Christine
When I rock the spot with the flavor I got
I get plenty of ass, so call me an ass-tronaut
As I blast past another nigga's ass that thought he was strong
But I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong
When I flow, niggas know, it's time to take a hike
'Cause I grab the mic and flip, my tongue like a dyke
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted
Produce a smokescreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E, I keep their motherfuckin' heads ringin'
Keep their heads ringin'
(Ring, ding-dong, ring-a-ding, ding, ding-dong) yeah, come on
If you want to get on down (uh, yeah)
You got to get on down (come on)
Just get on down (it's like that)
Debonair with flair, I scare wear and tear
Without a care, runnin' shit as if I was a mayor
But I ain't no politician, no competition
Sendin' all opposition to see a mortician
I'm up front, never in the back drop
Step on stage and get faded just like a flat-top
Your rhyme sounds like you bought 'em at Stop 'n Go
Dre came to wax you so, just call me Mop and Glo
Many tried to, but just can't rock with
I'm 6'1"", 225 of pure chocolate
Your chances of jackin' me are slim, G
'Cause I rock from summer 'til Santa comes down the chimney
Ho-ho-ho and so, as I continue to flow
'Cause yo, I'm just a fly negro, so
Check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E, I keep their motherfuckin' heads ringin'
Uh, I keep their motherfuckin' heads ringin'
(Ring, ding-dong, ring-a-ding, ding, ding-dong)

You got to get on down
Just get on down
If you want to get on down
You got to get on down
Just get on down

Who that one that do that boy? You knew that, true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches, like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani, they say she couldn't doubt me
Muthafucka', I say, ""Life ain't shit without me""
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'
I do what I do, and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain, dare me
Don't you compare me 'cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me, but they hear me
They don't feel me, but they fear me

Ah ha, hush that fuss
Everybody moves to the back of the bus
Do you wanna bump and slump with us
We're the type of people make the club get crunk

Many a day has passed, the night has gone by
But still I find the time to put that bump off in your eye
Total chaos, for these playas, thought we was absent
We takin another route to represent the Dungeon Family
Like Great Day, me and my nigga decide to take the back way

We stabbing every city then we headed to that bat cave
A-T-L, Georgia, what we do for ya
Bull doggin hoes like them Georgetown Hoyas
Boy you sounding silly, thank my Brougham aint sittin pretty
Doing doughnuts round you suckas like then circles around titties
Damn we the committee gone burn it down
But us gone bust you in the mouth with the chorus now

{au Refrain}

I met a gypsy and she hipped me to some life game
To stimulate then activate the left and right brain
Said baby boy you only funky as your last cut

You focus on the past your ass'll be a has what
Thats one to live by or either that one to die to
I try to just throw it at you determine your own adventure
Andre, got to her station here's my destination
She got off the bus, the conversation lingered in my head for hours
Took a shower kinda sour cause my favorite group ain't comin with it
But I'm witcha you cause you probably goin through it anyway
But anyhow when in doubt went on out and bought it
Cause I thought it would be jammin but examine all the flawsky-wawsky
Awfully, it's sad and it's costly, but that's all she wrote
And I hope I never have to float in that boat

Up shit creek it's weak is the last quote
That I want to hear when I'm goin down when all's said and done
And we got a new joe in town
When the record player get to skippin and slowin down
All yawl can say is them niggas earned that crown but until then...

Now everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy

[Verse 2]
2, here comes the 3 to the 4 to the 5
Now I'm lookin at shorty right in the eyes
Couple seconds passed now I'm lookin at her thighs
While she tellin me how much she hate her guy
Said she got a kid but she got her tubes tied
If you 21 girl that's alright
I wonder if a shake comin with them fries
If so baby can I get em super sized
Here comes the 4 to the 3 to the 2
She started feelin on my johnson right out the blue
Girl you super thick so I'm thinkin that's cool
But instead of 1 lifestyle I need 2
Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels
Expression on her face like she ain't got a clue
Then she told me she don't run with a crew
You know how I do but I guess one gotta do

[Chorus]
Now everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Now everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Now everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Now everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy

[Verse 3]
3, here comes the 4 to the 5 to the 6
Self explanatory I ain't gotta say I'm rich
This single man ain't tryna get hitched
Liquor wasted on me man son of a bitch
Brushed it all off now I'm back to gettin lit
Goose and orange juice man this some good ish
Homeboy trippin cause I'm starin at his chick
Now he on the sideline starin at my clique
Here comes the 5 to the 4 to the 3
Hands in the air if you cats drunk as me
Club on the set Kwon cut out them trees
Dude I don't care I'm a P.I.M.P

Now everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy

Can't understand how I last so long
I must have super powers
Rap 225 thousand hours
Get it calculated, do the math
I made a thousand songs that made you move your ass
And for the last 300 months
I made 16 albums with me on the front and they bump
Where you get your beats?
I heard 93 rappers say bitch like me
Two singers and ten comedians
And I'm still gon' yell it every time you see me in
What's my favorite word? Bitch
Why they gotta say it like $hort? Bitch
You know they can't play on my court
Can't hang with the big dogs, stay on the porch
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Where you get that from?
Grab the mic, spit one, let me hit that blunt
Pimp-C, 8-Ball and MJG
Keep spittin' that P to the I M P

Ain't nothin' but pimpin' these days, G

Your mind is gone, your brain is blazed
You've been wide awake for the last three days
Poppin' pills, it goes down for real
Don't stop, just keep rollin' down hill
Crash and burn, can't stand, fall back
You're doin' too much, you can't handle all that
Man, it's been way too long
Time to let the whole world play your songs
Like me, my shit gets around
Leave the country come back and hit The Town
I'm in Miami, New York and ATL
Houston and L.A., ask Dave Chappelle
About my rich bitch, he got her from me
And made 50 million dollars, I'm proud of you D
But I'm crazy, you don't wanna be like me
I come from East Oakland where the youngstas get hyphy
Blow it
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle

California love

[Chorus: Roger Troutman]
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends
I been in the game for ten years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre puttin' it down for Californ-i-a

[Chorus: Roger Troutman]
California knows how to party
California knows how to party (Yes, they do)
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'

[Post-Chorus: Roger Troutman]
Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it

[Verse 2: 2Pac & Dr. Dre]
Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreamin'
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'
Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys (Yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we throw grams
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down; give me love!

[Chorus: Roger Troutman]
California knows how to party
California knows how to party (Yes, they do)
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'

Now make it shake

Shake it, Cali
Uh, uh, West Coast
Uh, yeah, uh, uh, Long Beach in the house
Uh, yeah, Oaktown
Oakland definitely in the house
Frisco, Frisco

[Outro: 2Pac & Dr. Dre]
And you know L.A. up in here
Pasadena, where you at?
Yeah, Inglewood
Inglewood always up to no good
Even Hollywood tryin' to get a piece, baby
Sacramento, Sacramento where you at?
Throw it up, y'all! Throw it up, throw it up!
I can't see ya
Let's show these fools how we do it over on this Westside

Let's do it
I'm the definition of, half man, half drugs
Ask the clubs, Bad Boy, that's wassup?
After bucks, crush crews after us
No games, we ain't laughing much
Nothin' but big things, check the hit list
How we twist shit, what change but the name?
We still here, you rockin' wit the best
Don't worry if I write rhymes, I write checks
Who's the boss? Dudes is lost
Don't think 'cause I'm iced out, I'ma cool off
Who else but me? And if you don't feel me
That mean you can't touch me, it's ugly, trust me
Get it right dawg, we ain't ever left
We just, moved in silence and rep to the death
It's official, I survived what I been through
Y'all got drama, the saga continues
We ain't, goin' nowhere, we ain't, goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now 'cause it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't, goin' nowhere, we ain't, goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now 'cause it's Bad Boy for life
Ay, yo straight from the Harlem streets
I don't play, I push it down with the Harlem Heat
All a sudden niggas got a problem with me
They run around actin like the Black-o can't eat
And you know what? For some strange reason
I'm off of this medication, feeling deranged needing
For y'all to put the word out, we ain't leavin'
We tryin' to be rich before we do stop breathin'
Therefore we kinda hustle lames
Stay laying down our muscle games
Still turn niggas dreams to flames
You got the wire, if not I ain't sayin' no more names
You'll soon expire, no pain, nothing
I feel remorse, yes of course it's me and Diddy up first racing Porsches
With the big twin valve exhausts
On the cover of your Vibes, XXLs, and Sources, bitch
We ain't, goin' nowhere, we ain't, goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now 'cause it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't, goin' nowhere, we ain't, goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now 'cause it's Bad Boy for life
It ain't shit changed, since the Notorious (We miss you B.I.G.)
See everything still glorious
We still got warriors, still be the victorious
See it's a lot of them but it's more of us
Still got cash to blow, raps that flow
Still them cats that know, pack ya flow
That's fo' sho', bottles that pop
Joints that rock, play the background
Hand on my jock, holdin' my Glock
Money to get, cars to flip
Bars to sit at and sip Cognac wit' jewels that drip
Hoes to see, make sure they knowin' it's me
Drop that beat, can't believe that I MC
Bad Boy 'til the casket drop
Gotta love it, place nuttin' above it
It's on like that, don't believe, we ain't goin' like that
We're always gonna be here
We there every motherfucking year
We ain't, goin' nowhere, we ain't, goin' nowhere

I see no changes, wake up in the morning, and I ask myself
Is life worth living, should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor, and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares
One less hungry mouth on the welfare
First, ship 'em dope and let 'em deal the brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
It's time to fight back, that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother, but we can never go nowhere
Unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the devil take a brother, if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things changed, and that's the way it is
Come on, come on
That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Ooh, yeah
Come on, come on
That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww, yeah
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be acting right
'Cause mo' black and white is smokin' crack tonight
And only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven sent
We ain't ready, to see a black President
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
(I made a G today) But you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kid (I gotta get paid)
Well, hey, well, that's the way it is
Come on, come on
That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww, yeah
Come on, come on
That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww, yeah
We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat
Let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see, the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do
What we gotta do, to survive
And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace?
There's war in the streets and war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty, they got a war on drugs
So the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime, I ain't have to do
But now, I'm back with the facts givin' 'em back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimps smack you up
You gotta learn to hold ya own
They get jealous when they see ya, with ya mobile phone
But tell the cops, they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush, I bust this
That's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool?
But mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the pay backs
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
Rat-a-tat, tat, tat, tat, that's the way it is
That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is (Way it is)
Aww, yeah
That's just the way it is

That's just the way it is
Aww, yeah

Yeah, bounce it
Come on !

The first day of the rest of my life
X stand behing the mic like Walker Kronkike
Y'all keep the spotlight
I'm keeping my rhymes tight
Lose sight of wath you believe and call it a night
This ain't the light-weight, cake mix shit that you're used to
Teflon territory you just can't shoot through
You gon shoot who ? (who ? )

Not even on your best day
Rollin' the Wild West way, givin' it up
Leaving the whole world stuck not givin' a fuck
Laid in the cut now we break through in the rut
Hennesy and orange juice bay fill up a cup
Quick to grab Mary Jane by the butt and squeeze
Loosen up, let your hair down, and join the festivities
Overcrowd the house like lockdown facilities
Bitches be quick to give me brains while I post the range
Going up and down my dick like the stok exange

X rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
X won't ever say your own name when I come around
X stay on top but remain from the underground
X to the Z and we all in the family


X rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
X won't ever say your own name when I come around
X stay on top but remain from the underground
X to the Z and we all in the family

Ever since Xzibit has spit, been on some pimp shit
Approach every woman like a potential mistress
Shine bright, make sure that (X) stay tight
Cause tonight I might meet my next X wife
Mr Big Chief Reefa, Xzibit use his dick like a Visa
I run it throught and money come out
Runnin' your mouth, I'll have somebody run in your house
Ravel you spouse and have a little fun on the couch
Now you know that it was bound to happen

I came to give you what you lackin'
Whenever you hear them other niggas rappin
Rockin' chains, stadium, paladiums, cracked craniums
My whole skeleton is dipped in titanium
Drop tops sittin' on twenties
Using rappers like crash test dummies
Stacking' real estate and money
It's funny how things change overnight
When you thinking right
I beat the odds like Ike beat on his first wife

X rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
X won't ever say your own name when I come around
X stay on top but remain from the underground
X to the Z and we all in the family

X rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound

X won't ever say your own name when I come around
X stay on top but remain from the underground
X to the Z and we all in the family

What an event ?
We hardcore 100%
Making it stick, Los Angeles proudly presents
The real deal, how does it feel ?
No special effects
Yank the chain off of your neck
Demand the respect
Now all your conversations sound strange to me It be like everybody around me done changed but me
I stand alone on my own two feet
Stagger tracks, strangle the beat
Restless no time for sleep
Niggas be weak, I'm concrete like Benjamin Greet
It's a very thin line between a foe and friend

Straight to the chair (not these niggas again)
Comme back, bounce in the spot and slide right in
I ain't trying to see nothing but progress, regardless
Home of the heartless, move right, remain cautious
Represent nothing but the hustle and struggle
Hennesy, rock plenty of ice, making a double, now scream

X rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
X won't ever say your own name when I come around
X stay on top but remain from the underground
X to the Z and we all in the family

X rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
X won't ever say your own name when I come around

Uh, uh, Young Money, yeah, yeah

I know way too many people here right now

That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?

I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back

But I just can't remember it all

What am I doing? What am I doing?

Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me

I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over

'Til it's over, but it's far from over

Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it

Never drop the ball, fuck it y'all thinkin'?

Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'

'Bout to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett


I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home?

You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone

I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone

I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known

Got the gold thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas

All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers

Super-good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's

I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker

Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either

Point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer

It wouldn't be the first time I done it throwin' hundreds


When I should be throwin' ones, bitch, I run it

I know way too many people here right now

That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?

I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back

But I just can't remember it all

What am I doing? What am I doing?

Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me

I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over

'Til it's over, but it's far from over

One thing about music, when it hits you feel no pain

And I swear I got the shit that makes these bitches go insane

So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game


It's what comes with the fame and I'm ready for that, I'm just sayin'

I really can't complain, everything is kosher

Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roper

I really can't see the end getting any closer

But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over

So I'm riding through this city with my high-beams on

Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on

Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your wise friend on

If you thinkin' I'mma quit before I die, dream on

Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?

I'm really too young to be feeling this old

It's about time you admit it, who you kiddin'?

And nobody's ever done it like I did it


I know way too many people here right now

That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?

I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back

But I just can't remember it all

What am I doing? What am I doing?

Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me

I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over

'Til it's over, but it's far from over

Yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me

I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over

'Til it's over, but it's far from over"

I know I can (I know I can) 

Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 

If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)

I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)



Be, B-Boys and girls, listen up 

You can be anything in the world, in God we trust

An architect, doctor, maybe an actress 

But nothing comes easy it takes much practice

Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star

She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe

Singing songs, Lina Horn, but the younger version

Hung with the wrong person

Gotta astrung when I heard when 

Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose


Coulda died, so young, no looks ugly and old

No fun cause when she reaches for hugs people hold they breath

Cause she smells of corrosion and death 

Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring

Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing

So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how



I know I can (I know I can) 

Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 

If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)

I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)



I know I can (I know I can) 

Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 

If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)

I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)




Be, B-Boys and girls, listen again

This is for grown looking girls who's only ten

The ones who watch videos and do what they see

As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID

Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV

You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey 

Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be

Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be 

Older than you are, give yourself time to grow

You thinking he can give you wealth, but so

Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know

You thinkin life's all about smokin weed and ice

You don't wanna be my age and can't read and right

Begging different women for a place to sleep at night

Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish

If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this




I know I can (I know I can) 

Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 

If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)

I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)



I know I can (I know I can) 

Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 

If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)

I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)



Save the music y'all, save the music y'all

Save the music y'all, save the music y'all

Save the music



Be, be, 'fore we came to this country 


We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys

It was empires in Africa called Kush 

Timbuktu, where every race came to get books

To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans

Asian Arabs and gave them gold when 

Gold was converted to money it all changed 

Money then became empowerment for Europeans

The Persian military invaded 

They learned about the gold, the teachings and everything sacred

Africa was almost robbed naked

Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships 

Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went 

He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces

Shot up they nose to impose what basically 


Still goes on today, you see? 

If the truth is told, the youth can grow 

They learn to survive until they gain control 

Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes

Read more learn more, change the globe

Ghetto children, do your thing

Hold your head up, little man, you're a king

Young Prince thats when you get your wedding ring

Your man is saying ""She's my queen""



I know I can (I know I can) 

Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 

If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)

I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)



I know I can (I know I can) 

Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be)

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A...

[Jay-Z]
Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the 8th wonder of the world
The flow of the century.. oh it's timeless.. HOV'!
Thanks for comin out tonight
You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me
I appreciate that.. uuunnnh..


H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
Was hurtin 'em in the home of the Terrapins; got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthin 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' sheezy my neezy keep my arms so freezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Haters want me clapped and chromed it ain't easy
Cops wanna knock me, D.A. wanna box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof -- vamoose, son of a bitch!


[Chorus]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem get'cha damn hands up
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty y'all got to feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem get'cha damn hands UP!

[Jay-Z]
Holla at me...
I do this for my culture
To let 'em know what a nigga look like, when a nigga in a roaster
Show 'em how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry shady it need to be taken over

Label owners hate me I'm raisin the status quo up
I'm overchargin niggaz for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks so talk mo' bucks

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Yeah...
Hov' is back, life stories told through rap
Niggaz actin like I sold you crack
Like I told you sell drugs; no, Hov' did that
so hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the pro-jects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back, sellin they mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner, focused on the ave

Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamp post, why I got my hand closed?
Cracks in my palm, watchin the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail, the two things I hate
Succeed in this rap game, the two things that's great
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
What else can I say about dude, I gets bu-sy

[Chorus]

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A... (*repeat 4X to fade*)"

Fuck if they holl'in about Rule nigga, here's the real
I'll pop ya top like Champagne bottles that chill
Wear nothing but ice, smiles tinted up to The Greatest
Tell em I'm nice too, plus push them nice grooves
The Inc roll like duece man, I'm ol' G Bobby J.
And we sling at soccer fields the yay

They don't respect that, don't get your minds around
You'll get it pushed back, y'all don't want that
I send em to the morgue while keepin my bitches bouncin fa sho
""In Da Club"" with no gun, got em taking it off
Can't help that, I'm the nigga that puts it down
Once I hit that, that's if I'm up in the May (bach)
Fasten them holding the throwback, West 44 Lakers
Let's make no mistakes, resents take place
We'll still proceedger you with a gun in your face
When you got one in your waist, let's cock back nigga, air out the space!

[Verse 2 - Ja Rule]
The Rule be ""In Da Club"" rude motherfucker poppin the bubbly
When shit get ugly I hug the snub closely
But usually we still see your bitches
dancin' on some freak shit, trying to ride my dick
I can't handle it, 'long as they manage
To get they ass infront of my dick to dance to BIG's ""One More Chance""
Catching hate from a glance, but I'm a giant
These niggaz is mere ants, I'll stomp 'em wit his thang
Give bitches the back hand, pimp shit, it's not realistic
The game is helpless, (let's) not get it twisted
I'm young, black, and gifted, but still at the bottom

And stuck somewhere between Gomorrah and Saddam
I'm here to make this rap shit hotter than Harlem
Fuck the Dog, beware of Rule, cause I'm the problem
We'll still proceed you with a gun in your face
When you got one in your waist, let's cock back nigga, air out the space!
(C'mon!) We gon'

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Ja Rule]
Like Bush and Saddam, I'm a find out
Where Em Laden's hiding and bomb him first
It could be much worse, I could be hotter than yo scrubs
Mask and glove, gun hot from burnin ass up
I'd rather be bossed up, wit a bunch of broads

The preachers daughter screaming out ""Fuck the law!""
ya may have struck a chord, wit the Christians
But y'all got the freakiest bitches out of all the religions
And God gave me his blessings to handle my business
All these wanksta snitches, let the nina blow kisses
If she some how misses, he gon' meet the mistress
And ""Clap That Boy"" like Birdman and Clipse
I got these niggaz all over my dick, like hoes
I'm the star at these shows, I must be as hot as they come
We'll still proceed you with a gun in your face
When you got one in your waist, let's cock back nigga, air out the space!
(C'mon!) We gon'

Uh, uh, niggas is mad I get more butt than ash trays
Fuck a fair one, I get mine the fast way

Far from handsome, but damn a nigga tote (What you tote?)
More guns than roses, foes is shaking in their boots
Invisible bully like The Gooch
Disappear, vamoose, you're wack to me
Take them rhymes back to the factory

I see, the gimmicks, the wack lyrics
The shit is depressing, pathetic, please forget it
You're mad 'cause my style you're admiring
Don't be mad, UPS is hiring
You shoulda been a cop, fuck hip-hop
With that freestyle, you're bound to get shot
Not from Houston but I Rap-A-Lot, pack the gat a lot

Papa love it, when he does it
Niggas buzz it
But tell me, was it really just the flavor that be clogging your ears?
The most healthy behavior is to stay in the clear
It's all for you, it's really all for you (Now what?)
Hunchback, close your eyes try to munch that
Coil up your ankles let your Timbs tap
Bite the flavor it reacts to your gold caps

Electrocute a barracuda, I'm here to bring the drama

You better believe it's Busta Rhymes the great
We 'bout to rip the Tri-State, yo, yo
Hey hey hey!

Throw niggas in ditches, slap the ass of fat bitches
Wait one sec, as I get down
I'm rolling with the heavyweight connect to the stomping ground
Now, don't you get suspicious, I grant your wishes every time

Bring it vicious when I bust a rhyme
I know one thing the whole world least expected
Is how we all connected to break fool on the same record
Five new flavors on a beat, feel the fucking heat
I really think you should retreat while we blow up the street
Instead of copping pleas just freeze
Maintain the focus while we smoke these marijuana trees
When I get down I disappear, reappear and blow up
Everywhere, fucking with these flavas in ya ear

Drunk off Cris', mami on E
Can't keep her little model hands off me
Both in the club, high, singing off key
""And I wish I never met her at all!""
It gets better, ordered another round
It's, about, to go, down
Got six model chicks, six bottles of Cris'
Four Belvederes, got weed everywhere
What do you say, me, you, and your Chloe glasses (uh-huh)
Go somewhere private where we can discuss fashion?
Like, Prada blouse, Gucci bra (okay)

You wanna see how far I'ma go
How much I'ma spend but you already know
Zip, zero, stingy with dinero
Might buy you Cris', but that about it
Might light your wrist, but that about it
Fuck it, I might wife you and buy you nice whips
Ma, but you really gotta ride nice dick
Know how to work your hips and your head's priceless
Profess you love to Hov' and I'll never let you down
Get you bling like the Neptune sound
Okay, hot Hov', too hot to hold
Ladies love me long time like 2Pac's soul
Only way to roll, Jigga and two ladies
I'm too cold, Motorola, two way page me (C'mon)

Let me tell you what they say, when I'm pullin' off my drawers
They say ooooooooooh weeeee
Aiyo, aiyo
My games here to party, just to cut up a rug
Don't make me wanna cut up a thug
Now play something for D.J., cuz there's nothin' but love
Hosted by the ladies who lookin' for somethin' to rub
When we roll out, we roll on dubs, rollin' up bud
The Theodore Unit, we controllin' the club
Mamies, shakin' they ass, they throwin' it up
Like a B.E.T. commercial, I'm ""wrappin' it up""
Oooooh weee, ooh wee

Something new
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Niggas wanna try, niggas wanna lie
Then niggas wonder why niggas wanna die
All I know is pain, all I feel is rain
How can I maintain with that shit on my brain?
I resort to violence, my niggas move in silence
Like you don't know what our style is
New York niggas the wildest
My niggas is with it, you want it? Come and get it
Took it then we split it, you fuckin' right we did it
What the fuck you gon' do when we run up on you?
Fuckin' with the wrong crew
Don't know what we're goin' through
I'ma have to show niggas how easily we blow niggas
When you find out there's some mo' niggas
That's runnin' with yo' niggas
Nothin' we can't handle, break it up and dismantle
Light it up like a candle just 'cause I can't stand you
Put my shit on tapes like you bustin' grapes
Think you holdin' weight?
Then you haven't met the apes
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Is y'all niggas crazy? I'll bust you and be Swayze
Stop actin' like a baby, mind your business, lady!
Nosy people get it too, when you see me spit at you
You know I'm tryin' to get rid of you, yeah I know, it's pitiful
That's how niggas get down
Watch my niggas spit rounds
Make y'all niggas kiss ground just for talkin' shit, clown
Oh, you think it's funny?
Then you don't know me, money
It's about to get ugly, fuck it, dawg, I'm hungry
I guess you know what that mean
Come up off that green, rob niggas on ravine
Don't make it a murder scene
Give a dog a bone, leave a dog alone
Let a dog roam and he'll find his way home
Home of the brave, my home is a cage
Ayo I'ma slave 'til my home is a grave
I'ma pull capers, it's all about the papers
Bitches caught the vapors and now they wanna rape us
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Look what you done started, asked for it, you got it
Had it, shoulda shot it, now you're dearly departed
Get at me, dawg, did I rip shit?
With this one here, I flip shit
Niggas know when I kick shit, it's gon' be some slick shit
What was that look for when I walked in the door?
Oh, you thought you was raw? Boom! Not anymore
'Cause now you on the floor, wishin' you never saw
Me walk through that door with that .44
Now it's time for bed, two more to the head
Got the floor red, yeah, that nigga's dead
Another unsolved mystery, it's goin' down in history
Niggas ain't never did shit to me
Bitch-ass niggas can't get to me
Gots to make the move, got a point to prove
Gotta make them groove, got 'em all like ""Ooh!""
So to the next time you hear this nigga rhyme
Try to keep your mind on gettin' pussy and crime
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Talk is cheap, motherfucker!"

On the streets with a death wish

With that Brownsville mentality to Shanghai
Hey yo, I'm firing outta coppertop city with a whole empire
A clip full of blue-tips and a hand full of fiya!

Sometimes I rhyme slow, sometimes I rhyme quick
I was on 1-2-5 and Saint Nich
Chillin' with this chick, named Tondalea
Was a hot girl and everybody wanted to slay her
She wasn't fond of players
Only wanted ballers to spoil her
Six figures and camcorders
So what you trying to tell me, dear?
I got Bentley, Benz send in Mr. Belvedere
And I just want to blow your mind
I'm talkin' literally blow your mind (c'mon)

Ay yo, I came in the door, I said it before
I never let the ladies hypnotize me no more
But, back to the manuscript
'Cause I don't think you can handle this
From New York to Los Angles
I think the whole world is scandalous
I'm just trying to keep the candles lit
Let the party people dance to this
Get out your seat and clap your hands to this
Because I came too far for me to be bourgeois
It's a Bentley to you, to me it's a blue car
So Branson pass me a jar
'Cause these cats done went too far
One phone call send two cars
And still get searched by security guards (that's right)

DOVE:
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Tell me, mirror, what is wrong?
Can it be my De La clothes
Or is it just my De La song?
What I do ain't make-beleive
People say I sit and try
But whan it comes to being De La
It's just me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

It's just me myself and I

POS:
Now you tease my Plug One style
And my Plug One spectacles
You say Plug One and Two are hippies
No, we're not, that's pure Plug bull
Always pushing that we've formed an image
There's no need to lie
When it comes to being Plug One
It's just me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

DOVE:
Proud, I'm proud of what I am

Poems I speak are Plug Two type
Please oh please let Plug Two be
Himself, not what you read or write
Right is wrong when hype is written
On the Soul, De La that is,
Style is surely our own thing
Not the false disguise of showbiz
De La Soul is from the soul
And this fact I can't deny
Strictly from the Dan called Stuckie
And from me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

POS:
Glory, glory hallelu

Glory for Plugs One and Two
But that glory's been denied
By kizids and dookie eyes
People think they dis my person
By stating I'm darkly pack
I know this so I point at Q-Tip
And he states, 'Black is Black'
Mirror mirror on the wall,
Shovel chestnuts in my path
Please keep on up with the nuts
So I don't get in aftermath
But if I do I'll calmly punch them
In the fourth day of July
'Cause they tried to mess with
Third degree, that's me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I"

In broad daylight kidnap you
Best get clap through
Police stay on us like tattoos
Niggaz only grind 'cuz we have to
Money is power
Sling crack, weed and powder
Fiends come through every hour
It's all about that dollar
And we no deal with cowards
Weak lamb get devoured
By the lion in the concrete jungle

The weak fold and crumble

Better say quick who you close to
Don't come through if niggaz don't know you

Doing them damage

Then let me give it to you in Spanish

Still over in Brazil, sipping Mescotto
You must of forgot though
So I'mma take you back to the block yo
Put you on to how we rock yo
Some are boosting

Hit-men hired for execution, there's no solution

My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart

[Verse 2]
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art

[Bridge]
Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

[Verse 3]
But don't change your hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay, little valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's Day"

I'm drunk off last night's whiskey and coke
She'll make me shiver without warning
And make me laugh as if I'm in on the joke

And you can stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now

Tell me if I'm wrong, tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know, tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to

I'll wake with coffee in the morning
But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea
Outside the day is up and calling
But I don't have to be so, please go back to sleep

Stay with me forever

[Ella]
Autumn in New York
Why does it seem so inviting
Autumn in New York
It spells the thrill of first-nighting

glittering crowds and shimmering clouds
In canyons of steel
They're making me feel - I'm home

It's autumn in New York
That brings the promise of new love
Autumn in New York
Is often mingled with pain

Dreamers with empty hands

They sigh for exotic lands

It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again

[Louis]
Autumn in New York
The gleaming rooftops at sundown
Oh, Autumn in New York
It lifts you up when you run down

Yes, jaded rou?s and gay divorc?es
Who lunch at the Ritz
Will tell you that it's divine

This autumn in New York
Transforms the slums into Mayfair
Oh, Autumn in New York

You'll need no castles in Spain

Yes, Lovers that bless the dark
On the benches in Central Park
Greet autumn in New York
It's good to live it again

[trumpet solo]

[Ella]
Autumn in New York
That brings the promise of new love
Autumn in New York
Is often mingled with pain

Dreamers with empty hands
They sigh for exotic lands


It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again"

Just a jackknife, has MacHeath, yeah.....and he keeps it, out of sight
When the shark bites, with his teeth, dear....scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves, though, wears MacHeath, yeah..so there's not a trace, hmmmm of red

On the sidewalk...Sunday morning, ...lies a body oozin' life
Someone's sneakin' 'round the corner...is the someone, Mack the Knife?

From a tugboat.... by the river..... a cement bag's, droopin' down

Yeah, the cement's just for the weight, dear...bet you Mack, he's back in town
Looky here Louie Miller, disappeared dear...after drawing, out his cash
And MacHeath spends, like a sailor...did our boy do, somethin' rash?

Lullaby Of Birdland
That's what I'm
Always here when you sigh
Never in my wordland
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel
Have you ever heard two doves
Coo when they love
That's the kind of magic music
We make with our lips
When we kiss
And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'll cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell
And goodbye


Lullaby Of Birdland
Whisper low
Kiss me sweet
And we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky
Up Above
Oh Because we're in love

Lullaby Of Birdland
That's what I
Always here when you sigh
Never in my wordland
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel
Have you ever heard two tuttles doves
Bill and coo when they love

That's the kind of magic music
We make with our lips
When we kiss
And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I cried in my pillow
If You should tell me farewell

just a rhyme without a reason
Neverending maze, drift on numbered days

You'll fire your musket, but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand, there's no turning back
The bugle sounds, the charge begins
But on this battlefield, no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horses' breath
As I plunge on into certain death
The horse, he sweats with fear, we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near, yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day
We get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds take my horse below
And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear, I draw my parting groan"

Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops me

That there's not much left of me

In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live

Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this LIFE off from me

Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul

Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves, will he fall?

Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he travelled time
For the future of mankind

Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge

Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can

Save your life by keeping whispers unsaid

Children roam the streets, now orphans of war

Bodies hanging in the streets to adore



Royal flames will carve a path in chaos,

Bringing daylight to the night

Death is riding into town with armor,

They've come to take all your rights



Hail to the king, hail to the one

Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun

Hail to the king



Hail!

Hail!


Hail!

The King...



Blood is spilt while holding keys to the throne

Born again, but it's too late to atone

No mercy from the edge of the blade

Dare escape and learn the price to be paid



Let the water flow with shades of red now

Arrows black out all the light (light)

Death is riding into town with armor,

Either way they die, they die
They killed my wife and my baby, with hopes to enslave me

Paid by the alliance to slay all the giants

Fill the cracks in with judicial granite
Because I don't say it, don't mean I ain't thinking it

Something's Raped And Taken From Me From Me 

Life's Got To Always Be Messing With Me

Can't They Chill And Let Me Be Free?

Can't I Take Away All This Pain

I Try To Every Night All In Vain In Vain 

Sometimes I Cannot Take This Place

Sometimes It's My Life I Can't Take

Sometimes I Cannot Feel My Face

You've Never Seen His Fall From Grace



Something Takes A Part Of Me

You And I Were Meant To Be

I Cheat But For Me To Lie

Feeling Like I Have No Release

How Many Times Have I Felt Diseased?

Nothing In My Life Is Free

I needed time to think
To get the memories from my mind

That what I saw that night was real and not just fantasy?
Just what I saw in my old dreams
Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
'Cause in my dreams it's always there
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair
Night was black, was no use holding back
'Cause I just had to see, was someone watching me?
In the mist, dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or just some kind of Hell?

Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?

Seem to mesmerize, can't avoid their eyes

But everyone says different things

They're the ones to see

So they keep talking and they never stop
And at certains point you give it up
So the only thing that's left to think is this

I want out... leave me be
I want out... to do things on my own
I want out... to live my life and to be free

They tell me how I have to see
Things that I have seen already clear
So they push me then from side to side
They're pushing me from black to white
They're pushing'til there's nothing more to hear

But don't push me to the maximum
Shut your mouth and take it home
'cause I decide the way things gonna be

I want out... to live my life alone
I want out... leave me be
I want out... to do things on my own

NIGHTMARE!
Now your nightmare comes to life.

Dragged you down below
Down to the devils show
To be his guest forever
Peace of mind is less than never

Hate to twist your mind
But God ain't on your side
An old acquaintance severed
Burn the world your last endeavor

Flesh is burning
You can smell it in the air
Cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal (steal)


So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head
You're now a slave until the end of time here

Nothing stops the madness turning, haunting, yearning pull the trigger

You should have known
The price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here
Yeah
Oooooooh
It's your fucking nightmare
While your nightmare comes to life

Can't wake up in sweat
Cause it ain't over yet

Still dancing with your demons
Victim of your own creation

Beyond the will to fight
Where all that's wrong is right
Where hate don't need a reason
Loathing self-assassination

You've been lied to
Just to rape you of your sight
And now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel (feel)

So sedated as they medicate your brain
And while you slowly go insane they tell ya
""Given with the best intentions, help you with your complications""


You should have known
The price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here

Everybody to fear

Is looking so clear

Not to fall (fall! )

Or you'll end up like the others

Die (Die! ), die again (die! )
Drenched in sin (sin! )

And it's ours now to steal

Friend or foe?
There's no way to know
Through the battlefield of life
It's kill or be killed
So many times
It's a matter of degree
From being up on your luck
To down on your knees

It's a hellish inferno
This is war eternal

They try to change you
Crush and break you
Try to tell you what to do
They'd like to have control of you

Back against the wall
In danger of losing it all
Search deep inside
Remember who you are

It's times like these
When lines are drawn
Which side of the fence
Are you standing on?
There will come a day
Not so far away
When the hunter
Becomes the prey

It's a hellish inferno
This is war eternal

They try to change you

Crush and break you
Try to tell you what to do

Rolling thunder, piercing hail

Eagerly
We filled the waves with enemies
Hungrily
Ravens cawing

Home shore calls

We return on bloody seas
Twilight falls
Darkness crawling

So pour the beer for thirsty men
A drink that they have earned
And pour a beer for those who fell
For those who did not return

Raise your horns!
Raise them up to the sky!
We will drink to glory tonight
Raise your horns for brave fallen friends
We will meet where the beer never ends

No regrets
We went out to war and strife
To protect

King and country

Victory
Honor those who gave their life
Willingly
We will not grieve

And pour a beer for those who fell

Commit to forgetting it

Smother another failure

Lay this to rest

Console yourself

You're better alone

Destroy yourself

Absorb yourself

For the truth shall set you free

I'll turn the screws of vengeance

And bury you with honesty

Through the clouds shines the ray of the sun

I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them fall away

Mildewed and smoldering. Fundamental differing.

Pure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion

Disintegrating as it goes testing our communication

The light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so

We cannot see to reach an end crippling our communication.

I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them tumble down

No fault, none to blame it doesn't mean I don't desire to

Point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over.


To bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication

The poetry that comes from the squaring off between,

And the circling is worth it.

Finding beauty in the dissonance.

There was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away.

Mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting

I've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing

Doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication.

Cold silence has a tendency to atrophy any

Sense of compassion

Between supposed lovers/brothers"

Throw a punch, shards bleed on the floor
Tearing me apart but I don't care anymore.

The fiction you live in blindfold your eyes.

Is be aware and hold on tight

Before you go taking a walk in my world
You better take a look at the real world
'Cause this ain't no Mister Roger's neighborhood
Can you say, ""Feel like shit""?
Yeah, maybe sometimes I do feel like shit
I ain't happy 'bout it, but I'd rather feel like shit than be full of shit
And if I offended you, oh, I'm sorry, but maybe you need to be offended
But here's my apology, and one more thing
Fuck you!

Bring me down, you can't bring me down

does it feel right ?

things I thought I put behind me 
haunt my mind 

I just know there's no escape 
now once it sets its eyes on you 
but I won't run, have to stare it in the eye

won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside

stand my ground

getting stronger, coming closer 
into my world 

I can feel 
that it's time for me to face it 
can I take it?

of the life I held so dear 
but I won't run, there's no turning back from here

Now what necrophagous second coming
Backs from the cradle to enslave?
Sickle constellations
Stud the belts that welt the sky
Whilst the bitter winter moon
Prowls the clouds, dead-eyed
Shifting parent flesh, silk matricide
Watchful as she was upon eden
Where every rose arbour and orchard she swept
Hid the hissing of a serpent libido
In an ancient tryst with catastrophe
Soon hear that hissing now on the breeze
As through the plundered groves of the carnal garden
A fresh horror blows but ten billion souls
Are blind to see the rotting wood for the trees
This is the theme to a bitter armageddon
Nightchords rake the heavens

What use are prayers to that God?
As devils bay concenus for the space to piss
On your smouldering faith
And the the mouldering face
Of this world long a paradise lost

Dance macabre 'neath the tilt of the zodiac
Now brighter stars shall reflect on our fate
What sick activities will be freed when those lights burn black?
The darkside of the mirror always threw our malice back
I see the serpentine in your eyes
The nature of the beast as revelations arrive
Our screams shall trail to angels
Damned in flames repay
All sinners lose their lot on judgement day
We should have cut our losses as at calvary
But our hearts like heavy crosses held the vain belief
Salvation, like a promised nation
Gleamed a claim away
This is the end of everything you have ever known
Buried like vanquished reason
Death in season
Driven like the drifting snow
Peace, a fragile lover, left us fantasising war
On our knees or another fucker's shore
Heiling new flesh
To a crooked cross and a holy cause
What else be whipped to frenzy for?
This is the end of everything
Old adversaries, next of Eve
Now they're clawing back
I smell their cumming as through webbed panes of meat
Led by hoary death, they never left
Dreaming sodomies
We've bled upon our knees
Tablatures of gravel law
Shall see Gehennah paved
When empires fall and nightmares crawl

Anyone should bear.

Constant over stimu-lation numbs me

It any other way.

It's not enough.

I need more.

Nothing seems to satisfy.

I don't want it.

I just need it.

To feel, to breathe, to know I'm alive.

Finger deep within the borderline.

Show me that you love me and that we belong together.


Relax, turn around and take my hand.

I can help you change

Tired moments into pleasure.

Say the word and we'll be

Well upon our way.

Blend and balance

Pain and comfort

Deep within you

Till you will not have me any other way.

It's not enough.

Relax. Slip away.

Something kinda sad about

the way that things have come to be.

Desensitized to everything.

What became of subtlety?

How can it mean anything to me

If I really don't feel anything at all?

I'll keep digging till

I feel something.

Elbow deep inside the borderline.

Show me that you love me and that we belong together.

Shoulder deep within the borderline.

No matter how I try

No matter what I say

Of making every night seem bright as day

I can't deny reality as life gets smothered
If the lines can be read between
Maybe you can tell me then what it all means
Cause he who paints the big picture runs the whole scene
Locked down, I gotta get it out
Impending doom, a cloud above my head
Why me? My faith has been devout
Blasphemous? Am I better off dead?
Punishment, for all my sins
A burning thought inside my mind
Has me full of pity for all of human kind
As we move forth, we fall further behind
Fear of death, will my life go on?
Controlled fate? On the corner rolling dice
Punishment, but I've done nothing wrong
In my eyes, who really pays the price
My lament, for the human race
Guilty, punishment for all my sins
Dread the day that brings the truth
Punishment for what I've done
Sentence me for all my sins
Bound in fear for what I've got
Though not much it seems a lot
Life is death and no one wins
Bustin' my ass, another day another dollar, as I kneel down and I
Confess to the father that I'm suffering a burning question of
the truth, whether or not to pull the trigger or to jump right
off the roof, 'cause I did things normal and just like all my friends
but now I'm positive and life it all ends
Punishment, for all my sins, I repent
In reality, we all must face the fact that the majority
of the people are out there smoking crack, getting doped up,
shooting that shit into their veins, the question must be asked if
we have any brains left, or right or wrong in this son, a
question we all ask and must answer before long, 'cause no one
is safe in this world, what's the deal, the sentence is death and to
what court do I appeal?

Beams of fire sweep through my head
Thrusts of pain increasingly engaged
Sensory receptors succumb
I am no one now only agony

My crimson liquid so frantically spilled
The ruby fluid of life unleashed

Ripples ascend to the surface of my eyes
Their red pens drawing at random, at will
A myriad pains begotten in their wake
The bastard spawn of a mutinous self

The regurgitation of my micro nemesis
Salivating red at the prospect of my ruin, my doom


Malfunction the means for its ascent
Bloodletting the stringent voice to beckon my soul
So futile any resisting tension
As death-induced mechanics propel its growth

The implement, the device of my extinction
The terminating clockwork of my gleeful bane
The definitive scourge of its mockery
The end-art instruments lethality attained

Heed - it commands, heed my will
Bleed - it says, bleed you will

Falling into the clarity of undoing
Scornful gods haggle for my soul
Minds eye flickers and vellicates as I let go

Taunting whispers accompany my deletion

A sneering grin, the voice of my reaper
Chanting softly the song of depletion"

Runs a thick tide beneath

Ayy
Now days the pain follows me, deal with trauma privately
I don't wanna be a burden, I handle things defiantly
Spent a decade searching for a higher power guiding me
Figured out that faith is not up there, that it's inside of me
Act with execution, what's a plan with zero action?
Faced with bad habits knowing it's a magnet to my imbalance
I'm somewhere between confidence and arrogance
The middle ground is treacherous, I work on getting out of it
Pops is looking down, I feel him every time the sun shine
Back to being unsigned
I only got my bloodline with me going forward
Smokin' cookie 'til we dumb high
Heard you taking shots, we pulled up on 'em, they was gun shy
2PM in Rome, we at the chapel eatin' sun dried tomato's and a plum wine
Life been like a movie, I don't know how long the runtime
Hope it's an extended cut
But when I die, download my consciousness on to a thumb drive (Yeah)
And upload it to the masses when I pass
All my sets is holographic, life's as real as you imagine (Okay)
My Jewish girl was tight 'ccause I ain't link her on the sabbath
But it's Friday and I got a few robins I need to bask in
Play in traffic if you wanna play the faction
We don't act, we gettin' active
Stacking cash and dodging taxes
My father was a Catholic, never taught me how to practice
But with music I'm a Baptist (I'm a Baptist)
Christen all these fucking tracks I bless these raps with

You don't know what it's like, I come from outside of this
Out the quicksand, I'm the big man
Doin' big thangs, cop a big chain

Check the temp', I’m on fire with it (Right)

Go run up a check (Run it up)
Demand my respect (Yeah-yeah)

Touch my soul, touch my heart, don’t judge my mental

I saw that out in the rental

They told me that less is simple
I’m a servant in the room, I be flyin’ all on the wall
Open mouth conversations, I leave you all in some awe
Cuttin’ through the noise, I’m hopin’ I leave a scar
If you don’t know where you’ve been, how you knowin’ where you are, nigga?

Let’s cruise in the night, I’m groovin’ it
Thought you said you was my type, I’m movin’ too slow

I could match energies made my mood of your soul

[Verse 2: Witchitaw Slim]
Somethin’ threw off the time
Check my notifications, it was a love we was prepin’ for but was somethin’ adjacent
I can’t be wastin’ lines
I meant for somethin’ to say in the time where everything vacant and in between is not what it made out to seem
Everything is intention, but still, I tend to do it wrong
Can you fault me for wantin’ you, was you led alone?
Both hurt, but I was [?] you
I just thought it all to be or else I wouldn’t approach you
I put my heart on yo’ sleeve, war like a broach to you
And all in all, the outcome would be what it would be
You took a chance, I took the lead, we shook your sheets
Advanced and did the deed
Don’t blame me, we grown, it’s a natural thing

Look at me soarin' now
Givin' my soul, I pour it out
Been honest before what you seein' now
Back when I couldn't afford a house
I used to sleep in the Prius, no heater, on side of my campus
Dropped out for a job, I just couldn't manage, was rackin' up debt
Made it hard to see family, I ran outta panic, I started to grind at the studio
Don't tell my girl I was homeless (Wave)
Was wastin' that time that we coulda spent
Too focused, now foldin', I'm used to this
I'm not complainin', but shit to get hard
And I know what my worth is, I waited my turn
Look at me flourish
I want 'em to know what they seein' right now is me beatin' my curses

Lately, it feel like my mind is outta they range
I'm healin' to funnel the pain
Let me stop for a minute to see all the shit that we never did think we would see
We was just kids in the cul-de-sac
Bet I send the class with a giant heart
The memory caught in a photograph
I used to sit on the roof with my Daddy done, listen to trains go by
Then later, he told me he used to do things to numb out the feel of his brain on fire
Yeah
I'm not really sure what to say, 'cause the last time I seen him
His sister just passed, and I wasn't there, too busy, uh, they had me tweakin'
Addicted to people, perception of me
No niggas, they cast me as enemy
I used to wish I was current me
I'm excited to see who I'm finna be
I'm ready to grow to a better person, lookin' back, I'm already a better person
If you hate me, then hate me, so be it
First, let me give you the reason
Ayy
Wha-?

I can't be mixy when iffy the vibe
And 40 on 50 it's really the time
Why are you all on my phone like you want me?
Like you wasn't pushing the kid to the side
I don't know if you bitches is thinking I'm blind
Cross all my crosses and dot all my i's
Done with your efforts
I'm dealing with pressures
I know it's a lesson
That's word to the wise (Labb)
Dubbing the mixers I'm mixing
I know I been missing
I needed some personal time
Fuck all the pictures the mentions I don't want your digits
I mean it
I'm staying inside

'Cause bitch I got
Problems on

I'll solve em

Tell me I'm garbage
I'm going through something
That's why I ain't calling

Nuts on the ground, I'ma stand mine
Shook with them boys with the hand signs
Let me cook on them boys out the man mine
I'm a mix of the grits and the glow up
With the shit, turn the bricks for the blowup
Puttin' tips on the tits when I'm toe up
Gettin' rich than a bitch, I'ma go up
And I never ran, this my city, fool
Got a pump in the back like a kiddie pool
Put ten on the tank with the old-school
'Bout to use my stress like a pro tool
When I flick my wrist like a game of horse
Never need luck, I stayed the course
Glued to the game, I ain't divorced
Niggas followed them trends, I made the source goin'

Good book and a blunt by the bedside
Gotta finish my work for the weekend
Tryna bounce back on 'em for the peekin'
My fam' need bread, you keep the hoe
In a place where you ain't gon' meet the pope
It's cool, I know my shit for real
So I ain't gon' preach, they get the deal
Keep a couple ads out, it's a Ma Ville
And I ain't gon' cap, shit mad real
Young niggas bitch shit that your Dad feel
In the city, niggas know where I'm at still
But I'm South Park with it, I'm movin' different

Okay

[Verse 1]
I pull up, few deep with my niggas, 'cause shit here is pivotal
Trap through the app, make her clap it, no cappin', she tappin' in fast
I think that she know they be cashin' in
Standin' six feet out, castin' a shadow of niggas
They talk like they bad, even though that we doubt it
They talk far from actual, I make the race for tsunami
I dare you to paddle in
The trunk-steady rattlin'
Blowin' top tier to keep my thoughts clear
I see the op, then veer, I'm on my shot, call it big boss shit
I never know the time, I'm never clockin' in
Wildflower, I'm like Denzel, I've been the man on fire
Bitch, I'm hot lava, you are not scarlet, you a prop probably
I'm a real nigga 'til the coffin seal
Heart chill from all this talkin' real
Reach to life, feel like a highlight reel
Currently thumbin' through currency, I'm from the avenue, bitch, Imma get it regardless
I told Lil' baby to slide with that lotus
Pull up with the garden, my guard is down 'til you come around, tryna hold you somethin'
Give a fuck how you feel, I don't owe you nothin'
Now you tryna make amends (Wave)
I'm just tryna get the fortunes (Yeah)
Tryna cop my Mama fortress
Pop might pull in a Porcher
I used to be quiet, was timid
They used to catch me skippin' courses
Now they snap a nigga portrait
Hardhead, but never forced it

[Chorus]
I got a pendant
It shine like it's 'posed to
The way I delivered they postal
My neck got a compass to know where we goin', they sound like I'm steppin' through portals
I'm off of that poison, the Devil been callin', but I just ignore it, hit forward
The task force told me, ""Go up""

When I stage, bet they packed in
Got a pretty thang to make her back bend
Let me see it all through the glass lens
Had some people tryna snake, if I see you, I'm T'd up, might greet you with brass hands
Skate off fast, put a buck on the dash, to somewhere vast, with my feet up, wait, hold up
The label just called me to tap in
They just cut the checks up, so I'm up, and it's lit
I take for Jake to they neck, they're like stretch
To start my day, I hit the cash dance
Niggas is different now, I was down dead, but that's all in the past tense
So I can't stop shit 'til I'm top ten and I'm not ten
I'm so in love with the process
Not all in a day, but it took 'em some time, that bill wrong
I just copped the crib, never home
No, I can't keep it charged on the phone
So she think she in love with a ghost
When I'm home, I'm make sure that she get what she need so she know what I'm capable of
Know my rhythm could spar with the pros, they pay to hear what I'm on, they ask what I'm on
I'm doin' great, I suppose
'Cause I get to do what I want, it's legit, but it sound like it's straight from the stove
They play in the field, and they treat me like I'm makin' plays in the fourth
Know the beat, bang with a force
I'm a product of stayin' the course, yeah
I watch my step on the tightrope
The rate goin' up at a high slope
I don't got no work like balance
I'm never throwin' the towel in
The pin game hella nice with it
The flow heavy like a hydrant
But it come with a patent, I'm laughin', they badgerant, all of them boys they won't bite it

Uh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I like my coffee black, wife, too
Don't turn this to no controversy, it's my boo
I could make a quarter million off a high coupe
And I could make another quarter off, a times two
If it's money on the table, I be on it like Bobby or Epic
You peep the aesthetic, it's hard to forget it
I hear you talkin', but you're hardly right
I'm the voice of your prototype

Summertime in NY (You know how it goes, come on)

[Verse 2]
I'm talkin' 6 AM, tea times
Eighteen with the mayor talkin' land banks
I waited for it, gotta get mine
Snag a seat up at the table if my man can't
Headin' to a meetin' worth a million with no briefcase
Just my mind in a free state
I gotta plan through, a vision, but it takes time
I'ma make mine!

[Chorus]
Summertime in NY, yeah
Summertime in NY (Yeah, you know the drill by now)
Summertime in NY (Get everything together, get your squad together, get the gang together)
Summertime in NY, summertime in NY (You gon step like this, and step like that, step like this and step like that)

[Verse 3]
Started in a back office, now I run the front
Call the shots, make the deals, know the deal; know what's up
Too much for the books and I put it in a tux
Too much for the tuck, then I give it to my love
Once I make a mil', man, a meal won't be enough
Watch me fake the struggle while I get it off the hush
Now it's jet blue miles, Rolex dials, frowns turn to smiles

[Chorus]
Summertime in NY (Yeah, now as you come to an end)
Summertime in NY (And the fall's upon us, I want you to bring that energy to the summertime)
Summertime in NY (And run that thing back)

Ho that shit ther? like dip can
No rehears?, need no reverb
Ho, your lip don't say three words

Brought tree fur if you prefer
Quick ride, no time, I'm in there

No TikTok for that caca

Start to land, I be for the long run
I'm a slave for the cash, got snakes in the grass
No brakes on that, but it's all fun

I don't bank sets, I just bang on the set list
Don't pass up, but when I came for the breakfast
Put me in your prayers
I might put you on the guest list
Y'all niggers' reckless
Gold in my soul, got the same on my necklace
Light it up, light it up
I gotta light it up, light it up
Way up, way up
O-oh, light it up, light it up
I gotta light it up, light it up

On record off record, I let 'em take advantage I was wildin'
On record off record deals, tell 'em talk to Collin for the quote
On record off record, I still want the act, not the ghost
Runnin' through it with the young influence
Adolescent pressures, I'm succumbing to it
I've been giving yeses when I shouldn't do it
I complete objectives but the move's illusive
And I'm barely movin' but I'm still gon' boost 'em
I can't work on winnings when I know you're losin'
So I work their winnings and they throw the deuces
Guess I have to pivot, shooting ""No"" bazookas for the

That's a joke, tell 'em laugh, Uncle Sam, fuck out the bag
Rollie plot, with Getto Wack, contract, gimme the max

They tried to justify me goin' up like they don't know he raw

Out of the mud, it's showin' me love, my nigga, what's up?
Outta my way, bitch, I need the paper
Fuck what you want, I mean not no later

[Verse 1]
Poppin’ like I’m ‘posed to
Watch out for the people that I’m close to
Speak a little somethin’ you could toast to
I ain’t tryna hear ‘bout what you won’t do
Movin’ like I meant to
Hit the ground runnin’ like the rent do
Speak a little somethin’ that you’re into
I ain’t tryna hear ‘bout what you’ve been through
Like, hol’ up, hol’ up, say, what’s the hol’ up?
I got the pack, who got that roll up? I’m tryna po up
It seem like everytime I show up, it gotta go up
See the drip, they see the glow up, oh now they know us
See, it’s funny how my pockets outta shape but I’m fit for the flex
Clear the phone call, hit my chick with a text
Pollay through the birb with my drip from the Jex
Save a couple hunnid, buy your bitch with the rest, I

[Chorus]
Prefer my reefer with henny and Coke
Please don’t be stingy, got plenty to smoke
Show up and act up, and back to the crib
I do not stunt, I just rap what I live
Seem like they doin’ the most for the clout
Did what I said so they know what I’m bout
Show up and act up, and back to the crib
I do not stunt, I just rap what I (rap what I)

[Verse 2]
Ay
Winnin' like I ought to
I ain’t wanna do it, but I got to
Smokin’ when my doctor told me not to
Got these niggas wishin’ they was hot, too
Ballin’ like I need to
Got my exes wishin’ for a redo
Smell the marijuana when I speed through
Hit her with a tip, that’s a preview
Hold up, wait up, bitch, get your weight up
Shit, get your money, not your hate up
Boy, draw or play up
I flip my wrist, this shit a lay up, she wanna lay up
I gotta get it, I’ma stay up, I’m all the way up
I got my pay up, I ain’t playin’ with you hoes, I’m a coach now
Commentatin’, niggas do the most now
I’ll be somewhere booted with my toes down
Midler baby toot it with her nose down, I

[Chorus]
Prefer my reefer with henny and coke
Please don’t be stingy, got plenty to smoke
Show up and act up, and back to the crib
I do not stunt, I just rap what I live
Seem like they doin’ the most for the clout
Did what I said so they know what I’m bout
Show up and act up, and back to the crib

It never gets me down
City of mine
How I love, how I love this city of mine
It never gets me down, yeah

[Verse 1: Pandaraps]
I was born in the city, I was raised on its edges
My pop worked his life when it's calm, find some pop love in its center
If I could live here forever, think it'd be for the better
I love the weather, even though it's fog 24/7
I love the people
This the city I met all my best friends
And I wanna thank every brick
I wanna thank every entrance to every building that I steppin' in this city of mine
Oh he most my best moments in life
See, I fell in love for the first time in Golden Gate Park
I saw my first rap show at Great American Hall
I used to beg my homies for a ride across the bridge to goof off
And spend the whole damn day doin' whatever we want
Keek drove us down to ice place while we'd roll up a blunt
And me and Jack would get stoney, walk around, and get lost
Don't think I'll ever pay back, although it's lucky to get
Just by walkin' through the city, know I'm a small part of this

[Chorus: Snake City & Xavy Rusan]

How I love, how I love this city of mine
It never gets me down
City of mine
How I love, how I love this city of mine
It never gets me down (Look)

[Verse 2: Xavy Rusan]
Uh, I never really had a place to call my own
So I travel and I roam 'til I find that
But I'm fully adventurous so I wander and I venture
And it's safe to say that, really, I don't mind that
I book a flight to try to figure where my mind's at (Mind's at)
A spot where I don't spend no money, just some time at (Time at)
I mix and mingle with the people 'til I learn a little (Learn a little)
I brought some weed and baby, maybe we could burn a little (Burn a little)
She said, ""You're funny,"" I said, ""No, I'm Xavy,"" then I left (Ha)
Sun shinin', birds chirpin', let me take a breath (Okay)
I'm headed to the city where my chance to make it best
What, people like to give a little then you take the rest
I'm hopin' one day, maybe I can find a place to rest
I fell in love with life and wonder where it take me next
I like to hustle and bustle, I fell in love with the fashion
I feel the pulls to the city, it's movin' me like a passion and it's mine

City of mine
How I love, how I love this city of mine
It never gets me down
City of mine
How I love, how I love this city of mine
It never gets me down, yeah

Me and my hometown, baby, we go way back
'Gardless situations, circumstances, still, we don't mind
Steady goin' on, I'd dance around the streetlights
Hey
I know every street sign
Hang in 'round the block, like
If you are my friend then you are welcome any moment

Aight
Let me get this line
(Cough)
Wave

[Verse 1]
My life been lookin' gorgeous
Take one leg at a time, I pray I'll never have to force it
Got bad women for me, tell they man he need to forfeit
I'm standin' with the torch gripped in my hand, I'm hella condo of the palm, hold my fortune
I live ready to die, my momma hate me, soundin' morbid
Growin' up, my daddy got up in chasin' fortune
He'd probably be more proud if I was doctor or a lawyer, but I'm paid to be in line, we're only livin' in the moment
And I can't have my target, want me locked behind these bars, I'm in a spot that I can't conquer
Well, fuck it, 'cause we livin', my nigga
And I'm addicted to feelin' like I'm invincible, take the bag, then I triple it, the flow been on the pinnacle, vivid dreams of a miracle
Where I made it out of bond
Lately, I'm so out of mind, it's hard to wanna go outside, 'cause they've been killin' off my kind
But I've gotta hold my head and keep it loyal to the players, don't let 'em rob you want protection of yourself
Niggas lyin' for a check, I call it brobin' for the flex
'Til the label drop your ass, the bank collect on your advance
Tremble lightly 'cause the man don't give a fuck about your plan To see the world and feed your fam, the block is hot, it's hard as stain
I'm from the cove, my money talks, been on the low
They got the stoves, somehow the babies still ain't eatin' all they crabs stuck in the bucket tryna make it out the street shit
How we make it where we at, bitch trace the bloodline back to Eden
I'm a menace, a remnant of the pandemic, got the mask off, I'm flat jaw
Takin' no L's, I'm at the coattails to the cash cause
Yeah, (Wave)
I'm takin' no L's, (I'm takin' no L's, I'm at they coattails to the cash cause)
Look
Ay (Look)

[Verse 2]
They're really not who they claimin'
They talk it foul but they Cap Lock
My heart is cold, keep it padlocked
My mind is cold, need it Kevlar
They sent the shot, but can't stick me
I dropped the ball in my lesson
I dropped the class with the schedule
I can't afford to be bored
Bet a couple of bros, made through the school with degrees
Can't lend the interview, they pay more than a minimum wage
They pull up suited, but they talkin' them 'bout the dreads on they head
In it be they resume, they can't say they name
That shit is shame
The system got it easy here, they claim she need to relax
Got a couple kids, a single mom, they laid her off back in March
She lost her crib, they sent the SWAT to throw her back to the street
That'd freeze her, writ the stimulus, won't even see her address
I'm thinkin' cash rules everything, they gotta spot a culture
Spend a couple of racks to keep the art scene postin'
When we ask for what we owe, they wanna talk like they ain't got it
Sign the next man at a lower rate to help 'em bag a fortune
So we torch it
We burn it all down 'til y'all get, bitch
I'm native to the sand, don't give a fuck about no pilgrim
When the Police snap my neck, my brother hangin' by a branch, and I can't even pay his bond, because we stretched a dollar thin
Tell me, how we supposed to win, huh?
They sellin' dope to keep us clothed, to pay the rent, huh?
A lot to hold, but I ain't fold, I'm still on ten, huh?
Toes planted in the soil, gettin' hard to keep it cultured, but that's just the way it go-

[Outro]
As fast as you can
Ay
Run
Aaah
As fast as you can
Yeah
I can really get away
Lord make me feel awake
I just wanna get away from it all
I just need an escape"

Life of a legend, just a day in the life
Might slide on ya, I ain't stayin' the night
I ain't pick cards, I'm just playin' 'em right
Photo shoot tomorrow, they gon' play for the flight
Amazin' the height I'm able to reach from just rappin'
Get it all a jit, my nigga, so fuck trappin'
Catch me in the lab, I'm a player with the game plan
And I stick to it, we are really not the same, man
Nothin' make these motherfuckers change like the game can
In too deep, I'ma really be a name brand
I levitate, got you lookin' like a caveman
Talkin' like you winnin' doin' only what a slave can
I'm gettin' money so I'm knowin' why they mad at me
Quarter-ounce of literary, magic in the Glad baggie
Word to the plug, hope your baby stay fed, nigga
I'ma keep you livin' with a pocket full of dead niggas
And I came up from the eyes, they can't fathom
So I'ma need all my Lil' coins, you can't have 'em
But I'd probably drop a couple blessings on the way out
Give a Lil', get a Lil', watch it comma play out
Royal gettin' royalties, I'm waitin' on the pay out
Loyal to the soil, but we manifest the way out, uh
Thank God for the love and the upcomin'
I was blessed with the flows, got my cup runnin'
Ain't no fear in the black man, fuck runnin'
Dicky tryin' us, my travel niggas goin' Duck Hunt

We was thirteen, playin' with a ratchet and some ratchet hoes
Side of town where niggas grow rapid, oh, we had to grow
On a need to know unless a motherfucka had to know
Posin' for the cameras like you tryna get a action role
I'm beneficial, you ain't beneficial to me, boy
Country bumpkin' Booney Boy, prayin' like a soon-ey boy
Say they wanna make a difference, they ain't movin' different, no
Passin' drugs with a handshake, that's a give and go
Lotta loud niggas from my hood, they ain't livin', no
Talkin' like he Jordan, a nigga ain't even Pippen, no
I hear the shit that you sayin', but put your chest in it
I'm the best in it, won't answer to nothin' less than it
I'm everything like your favorite rapper, but less timid
More organic, and less rented, I'm blessed with it
I got the shit that could shift minds with six lines
Tellin' tall tales, you 6'9'', my bitch fine
Catch a flight to the future, nigga, I switched times
Changed for the dolla, a bought a .40, you six dimes
Ghetto niggas who done moved to the 'burb side
Sippin' liquor curbside, now I'm makin' words ride
Better livin', I see this shit from a bird's eye
Learn to do my talkin' with numbers, I know the words lie
Highly favored, you fabricated and fictitious
I'm light bearin', I flick switches for quick riches
My shit vicious, come get stitches, it hit different
He hit my line 'cause his chick missin', no pic' flickin'
I'm dictatin', you dick ridin' and dick lickin'
Bickin' back big flickin', niggas know my shit kickin'
I said these niggas know my shit kickin'

[Chorus]
'Cause sometimes it be like that (Sometimes it be like that)
I wish it didn't be like that
But sometimes it be like that
I wish it didn't be like that
'Cause sometimes it be like that
I wish it didn't be like that
'Cause sometimes it be like that
I wish it didn't be like that
It didn't be like that, it wouldn't

[Verse 3]
And if I ever fall off, I could fall back
I could probably lose it all, get it all back
You waitin' on a white man in the call back
They ain't give it to us, we took it, now what you call that?
Thirty hours, five songs, I'm a hit maker
Fuckin' with the God body, you a risk taker
I'm overseas, you a overtime shift taker
All buildup, no action, these niggas cliffhangers
I quit stressin', I'm livin' my best life now
I can't fuck with these hoes, only my wife now
I leave the crib and she waitin' there in a nightgown
Fuck all of these haters, this wave makin' a lifestyle
Quarter-ounce of cookies, makin' crypto plays
Higher platform like a disco phase
With my same niggas from the Sisqo days
I'm out in Cali with the grower makin' Frisco plays
I miss those days when niggas was actually fact-droppin'
Go and tell the world real niggas is back poppin'
Rim still spinnin' as the lack stoppin', and I ragtop it, just so I'm seein' the backdroppin', nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it be like that
'Cause it be like that, look

[Chorus]
'Cause sometimes it be like that
I wish it didn't be like that
But sometimes it be like that
I wish it wouldn't be like that
But sometimes it be like that
I wish it didn't be like that
'Cause sometimes it be like that
I wish it wouldn't be like that
It wouldn't be like that, it wouldn't

We've been running for ages to search some light
I want you
I know we both escape
To lose the ground
We've been running for ages to search some light
We can feel that we're there
After running for nights
We feel so alive
I run away with you
To see some light
When ash is dropping down, we step aside
I run away with you
To see some light
When ash is dropping down
To build our own"

You got me thinking ""all I did was wrong""
Guess you got all you wanted
Yeah, out of nowhere suddenly you're gone
You'll never be forgotten

[Pre-Chorus]
Pretending no one is to blame
Too late to reignite our flame

[Chorus]
How did I not see you running?
How did I get left behind?
How did I not see this coming?
Guess all of you left me blind

[Drop]
Guess all of you left me blind
Guess all of you left me blind

How did I not see you running?
How did I get left behind?
How did I not see this coming?
Guess all of you left me blind
How did I not see you running?
How did I get left behind?
How did I not see this coming?
Guess all of you left me blind

[Post-Chorus]
So icy

[Verse 2]
In retrospect I could've paid attention
I could've tried harder, been smarter
Deep water had me drown
I should've felt fought the tension
Over reacted and acted childish, impacted us all around
When you were pushing me away
I should've tried to give you space and get out of your way
How didn't I see this coming?
You leaving one day

[Pre-Chorus]
Pretend that no one is to blame
Too late to reignite our flame

[Chorus]
How did I not see you running?
How did I get left behind?
How did I not see this coming?
Guess all of you left me blind

[Drop]
Guess all of you left me blind
Guess all of you left me blind
